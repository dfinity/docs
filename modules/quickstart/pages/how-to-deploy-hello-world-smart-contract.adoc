How to deploy a "hello world" smart contract/dapp in 20 minutes
===============================================================

This is a fast and minimalist tutorial for deploying a "hello world" smart contract or dapp to the IC in 20 minutes or less. All that is necessary to run this tutorial is basic knowledge of using a terminal (no editing of code).

== Introduction

In this tutorial, we will deploy a simple `Hello` canister smart contract that has just one function—called `greet`. The `greet` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting. For example, if you call the `greet` method with the text argument `Alice`.

a. If you call it via the command-line, dapp will return `Hello, Alice!` in a terminal
b. If you access the dapp in a browser, it will alert pop-up window reading `Hello, Alice!`

While the code comes ready out of the box for you, this dapp consists of back-end code written in Motoko, a programming language specifically designed for interacting with the Internet Computer (IC), and a simple webpack-based front-end. 

=== Concepts necessary for this tutorial

* A *canister smart contract/dapp* is a type of smart contract that bundles code and state. A canister can be deployed as a smart contract on the Internet Computer and accessed over the Internet.

* A *cycle* is the unit of measurement for resources consumed in the form of processing, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. For the sake of this tutorial, this is analogous to Ethereum's gas: it is what one needs to run their dapp, but it is much more stable and cheaper for developers to use. Every canister has a cycles account to which resources consumed by the canister are charged. The Internet Computer's utility token (ICP) can be converted to cycles and transferred to a canister. ICP can always be converted to cycles using the current price of ICP measured in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights[SDR] using the convention that one trillion cycles correspond to one SDR. **In this tutorial, you will get free cycles from the cycles faucet.**

== Platforms and operating systems supported 

* Linux
* macOS (12.\*.*)

== 1. Installing tools (5 min)

To build a dapp, users need to install the following:

=== 1.1 Node.js

This tutorial works best with node.js version higher than `16.*.*`.

There are many ways of installing node.js, including from link:https://nodejs.org/en/download[nodejs.org website].

Besides installing node.js, users need to also install:
* Node Package Manager (NPM).
* Node Version Manager (NVM), see link:https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating[installing NVM].

=== 1.2 The Canister SDK (AKA "dfx") 

The Canister SDK used in this tutorial is called `dfx` and it is maintained by the DFINITY foundation. There are many SDK's so this is just one.

To install, one needs to run:
[source,bash]
----
$ sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----


To verify it is properly installed:
[source,bash]
----
$ dfx --version
----

Terminal should look like this (at least version 0.9.2):

image:quickstart/dfx-version.png[dfx version]

== 2. Create a default project (2 min)

=== 2.1 Launch a new project 
Dapps on the Internet Computer start as projects, which are initiated by using the dfx parent command and its subcommands. You create projects using the `dfx` parent command and its subcommands. This tutorial starts with the default sample dapp to illustrate how to create a dapp using the starter files in a project. When you create a new project, the `dfx`` command-line interface adds a default project directory structure to your workspace. 

To create a new project for your first application:

==== 2.1.1 Open a terminal shell on your computer and create a new project named "hello"

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx new hello
----

The `dfx new hello` command creates a new project directory named `hello`, template files, and a new `hello` Git repository for your project. Your terminal should look like this:

image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-1.png[dfx new]

image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-2.png[dfx new]

==== 2.1.2 Move to your project directory
[source,bash]
----
$ cd hello
----

Your directory should look like this:

image:quickstart/cd-hello.png[cd new]


== 3. Deploying dapp to local machine (3 min)

=== Using two terminal windows/tabs

Now that the code is there, the next step is to spin up a local version of the IC on local machine. For this, developers should keep two terminals open:

* *Terminal window/tab A:* 

** Shows the local version of the IC running
** Is analogous to how developers often start local servers in web2 projects (e.g. node.js's Express, python's Django, Ruby's Rails, etc...)

* *Terminal window/tab B:* 
** Used to send *messages* to the local version of the IC
** Is analogous to how developers send HTTP API messages to servers running locally (e.g. Postman, Panic).

For ease, this tutorial will distinguish between both windows by color scheme:

=== Terminal A

image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-2.png[dfx new]


=== Terminal B

image:quickstart/terminal-b-ls.png[terminal b ls]


=== 3.1 Start the local version of the IC (Terminal A)

Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary. In this tutorial, you should be in the folder `hello` because that is the name of the project created in section 2 above.

Start the local canister execution environment in Terminal A:

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx start
----

image:quickstart/terminal-a-dfx-start.png[dfx start]


Notes: 

*  Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click "Allow." 

* Check no other network process is running that would create a port conflict on 8000.

*Congratulations - there is now a local version of the IC running on your machine. Leave this window/tab open and running while you continue.* If the window/tab is closed, the local version of the IC will not be running and the rest of the tutorial will fail.

=== 3.2 Deploy the "hello" dapp to the local version of the IC (Terminal B)

Note: since this is a local version of the IC, this section has fewer steps than deploying to mainnet (which requires cycles).

To deploy your first dapp locally:

==== 3.2.1. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.

Ensure that node modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command (it does not hurt to run this many times):

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install
----

image:quickstart/terminal-b-npm-install.png[npm install]

==== 3.2.2. Register, build and deploy dapp:

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx deploy
----

image:quickstart/terminal-b-dfx-deploy.png[dfx deploy]

Your dapp is now composed of two canister smart contracts, as you can see in the copy below (from terminal B):

[source, bash]
----
Installing code for canister hello, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
Installing code for canister hello_assets, with canister_id ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
----

a. `hello` canister `rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai` which contains the backend logic.

b. `hello_assets` canister `yjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai` which contains the frontend assets (e.g. HTML, JS, CSS).

=== 3.3 Testing the dapp locally via command line (Terminal B)

Now that the canister is deployed to local replica, you can send it a message. Since the canister has a method called `greet` (which accepts a string as a parameter), we will send it a message.

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx canister call hello greet everyone
----

* The `dfx canister call` command requires you to specify a canister name and a method—or function—to call.
* `hello` specifies the name of the *canister* you want to call.
* `greet` specifies the name of the *function* you want to call in the `hello` canister.
* `everyone` is the text data type argument that you want to pass to the `greet` function.

=== 3.4 Testing the dapp locally via the browser

Now that you have verified that your dapp has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let's verify that you can access the front-end using your web browser.

==== 3.4.1 On terminal B, start the development server with:

[source,bash]
----
$ npm start
----

==== 3.4.2  Test dapp locally in the browser

To see your dapp running locally in the browser on +http://localhost:8080+.

image:front-end-prompt.png[Sample HTML page]

. Type a greeting, then click *Click Me* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:front-end-result.png[Hello, everyone! greeting]

=== 3.5 Stop the local canister execution environment

After testing the application in the browser, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it does not continue running in the background.

To stop the local deployment:

. In the terminal A, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. In the terminal B, press Control-C to interrupt the development server process.

. Stop the local canister execution environment running on your local computer:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----

== 4. Deploying on-chain (10-15 min)

Deploying on-chain is as simple as modifying the `dfx deploy` command. 95% of the work in this section will be in acquiring and managing cycles which you will use to deploy.

=== 4.1 Cycles: an Introduction

In order to run on-chain, IC dapps require cycles to pay for compute and storage. This means that the developer needs to acquire cycles and fill their canister with them. Cycles are created from ICP token. 

This flow may be surprising to people familiar with Web2 software where they can add a credit card to a hosting provider, deploy their apps, and get charged later. In Web3, blockchains require their smart contracts consume *something* (whether it is Ethereum's gas or the IC's cycles). The next steps will likely be familiar to those in crypto or blockchain, but new entrants may be confused as to why first step of deploying a dapp is often "go get tokens."

Additional notes about cycles: 

* There is a free link:cycles-faucet{outfilesuffix}[free cycles faucet] that grants new developers 15 trillion cycles 

* It takes 100 billion cycles to deploy a canister, but in order to load up the canister with sufficient cycles, `dfx` injects 3 trillion cycles for any canister created (this is a parameter that can be changed).

* You can see a table of compute and storage costs here: link:../developers-guide/computation-and-storage-costs{outfilesuffix}[Computation and storage costs].

In this tutorial, we present two ways of acquiring cycles: 

* Option 1: Section **4.2** shows one how to get cycles via the cycles faucet (most common for new developers)
* Option 2: Section **4.3** shows one how to get cycles via ICP token (most common for developers who want more cycles)

=== 4.2 Option1: Acquiring cycles via free cycles faucet (2 min)

For the purposes of this tutorial, you can acquire free cycles for your "hello world" dapp from the cycles faucet. Follow the instructions here: link:cycles-faucet{outfilesuffix}[Claim your free cycles].

==== 4.2.1 Check your cycles balance (Terminal B)

Now that you have used the cycles faucet, you can check your cycles balance: 

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx wallet --network ic balance
----

You should see around 15 trillion cycles if you run this after using the cycles wallet. If so, you can skip to section **4.4**.

If you do not see any cycles, deploying on-chain in the rest of the tutorial will not work. You should try section **4.3**.

=== 4.3 Option 2: Acquiring cycles via ICP token (5 min)

==== Basic Summary of this section
To create cycles from ICP (to power your canisters), the basic steps (which we will dive deeper in are):

1. Transfer ICP to the `account id` controlled *by your local version of `dfx`*.
  * Note: Ths typicall requires transferring ICP *from an exchange, wallet, or NNS Frontend dapp* to the `acccount id` controlled by `dfx`.
2. Use `dfx` to tell the Ledger canister holding your ICP tokens to convert your ICP into cycles. 
  * Note: This only works if the `account id` controlled `dfx` has ICP tokens.
3. Use `dfx` to create a canister using the cycles created in step 2.

==== 4.3.1 Transfer ICP to the `account id` controlled *by your local version of `dfx`*

When you first installed `dfx`, it created and saved locally "developer identity" composed of:

* a Ledger `account id` - this is where ICP controlled by `dfx` are stored. 
** Example: `03e3d86f29a069c6f2c5c48e01bc084e4ea18ad02b0eec8fccadf4487183c223`. 
** We will use this in 4.3.1.

* a `principal` - A principal is an identifier for an entity on the IC such as a user, a canister (dapps/smart contracts), or a subnet. In this case, `dfx` has a principal which is how it identifies itself to the IC. 
** Example: `tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe`
** We will use this in 4.3.2

1. Find the Ledger `account id` controlled by dfx:

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx ledger account-id
----

2. Transfer ICP to the Ledger `account Id`

You can transfer from any exchange, wallet, or NNS Frontend dapp by sending ICP tokens to the `account id` from Step #1 above. For the sake of this tutorial, sending it 2 ICP tokens would be more than enough to deploy.

3. Confirm there is ICP in the account 

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx ledger --network ic balance
----

If there is no ICP in the account, the rest of the tutorial will not work.

==== 4.3.2 Use `dfx` to tell the Ledger canister holding your ICP tokens to convert your ICP into cycles

Now that your `account id` has ICP tokens, we need to tell the Ledger Canister to convert it into cycles for us. The Ledger canister needs to know WHICH PRINCIPAL will control the cycles created, so we will send it the `principal` created locally by `dfx` as part of the developer identity.

Note: Savvy readers may wonder why Ledger Canister needs to know the `principal` at all since the `principal` controls `account id`. The answer is that `dfx` can actually set a *different* principal in case it wants another entity to controls the cycles created in this step.

We will use this structure:

[source,bash]
----
// This is just the structure, this will not run
$ dfx ledger --network ic create-canister $PRINCIPAL --amount $ICP_TOKEN_AMOUNT
----

* $PRINCIPAL = the `principal` created by `dfx` locally as part of the developer identity.
** Example: `tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe`
* $ICP_TOKEN_AMOUNT = the amount of ICP to convert into cycles.
** Example: 0.5

[source,bash]
----
// This is just an exmaple, this will only work with YOUR principal
$ dfx ledger --network ic create-canister $PRINCIPAL --amount $ICP_TOKEN_AMOUNT
----

Filling it in with our example

==== 4.3.3 Use `dfx` to create a canister using the cycles created in step 4.3.2

=== 4.4 Check the connection to the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet (Terminal B)

As sanity check, it is good practice to check if your connection to the IC is stable:

Verify the current status of the Internet Computer blockchain and your ability to connect to it:

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx ping ic
----

If successful you will see an output resembling the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ {
  "ic_api_version": "0.18.0"  "impl_hash": "d639545e0f38e075ad240fd4ec45d4eeeb11e1f67a52cdd449cd664d825e7fec"  "impl_version": "8dc1a28b4fb9605558c03121811c9af9701a6142"  "replica_health_status": "healthy"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 129, 76, 14, 110, 199, 31, 171, 88, 59, 8, 189, 129, 55, 60, 37, 92, 60, 55, 27, 46, 132, 134, 60, 152, 164, 241, 224, 139, 116, 35, 93, 20, 251, 93, 156, 12, 213, 70, 217, 104, 95, 145, 58, 12, 11, 44, 197, 52, 21, 131, 191, 75, 67, 146, 228, 103, 219, 150, 214, 91, 155, 180, 203, 113, 113, 18, 248, 71, 46, 13, 90, 77, 20, 80, 95, 253, 116, 132, 176, 18, 145, 9, 28, 95, 135, 185, 136, 131, 70, 63, 152, 9, 26, 11, 170, 174]
}
----

=== 4.4 Deploying on-chain (Terminal B)

You are now ready to deploy your dapp on-chain.

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install
----

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx deploy --network ic
----

The `--network` option specifies the network alias or URL for deploying the dapp. This option is required to install on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet.

If succesful, your terminal should look like this: 

[source,bash]
----

----

In the example above, we created a `hello` dapp that is composed of two canisters: 

a. `hello` canister `5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai` which contains the backend logic.

b. `hello_assets` canister `5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai` which contains the frontend assets (e.g. HTML, JS, CSS).

Note: you will notice that the canister ids of for the same project are different between the local and the on-chain environments.

=== 4.5 Testing the on-chain dapp via command line (Terminal B)

Now that the canister is deployed on-chain, you can send it a message. Since the canister has a method called `greet` (which accepts a string as a parameter), we will send it a message.

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx canister --network ic call hello greet '("everyone": text)'
----

Note the way the message is constructed:

* `dfx canister --network ic call` is setup for calling a canister on the IC

* `hello greet` means we are sending a message to a canister named `hello` and evoking its `greet` method

* `'("everyone": text)'` is the parameter we are sending to `greet` (which accepts `Text` as its only input).

=== 4.6 See your dapp live on-chain via a browser

Find your new canister's ID:

[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network ic id hello
----

Take that canister id and visit +https://<canister-id>.ic0.app+, inserting your own canister id as the subdomain in the URL.
