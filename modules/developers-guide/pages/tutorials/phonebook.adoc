In this tutorial, you are going to write a simple program that enables you to store and look up telephone numbers. 
This tutorial illustrates how to import and use a few basic standard library functions.

For this tutorial, the standard library functions are defined in the  `+list+` and `+assocList+` library files and enable you to work with lists as linked key-value pairs. 
In this example, the *key* is a `+name+` and the *value* is the `+phone+` text string associated with that name. 

This program supports the following types of function calls:

* The `+insert+` function call accepts the `+name+` and `+phone+` key-value pair as input stored in the `+book+` variable.
* The `+lookup+` function is a query that uses the specified the `+name+` as input to find the associated phone number.

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the SDK as described in
link:../getting-started{outfilesuffix}[Getting started].
* You have stopped any network client processes running on the local
computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already
have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new phonebook
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd phonebook
----

////
== Modify the default configuration

You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default `dfx.json` configuration file to your project directory.
In this tutorial, you will modify the default setting for the program name to illustrate how you can customize your project environment.

To modify the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor, then change  the default `+main.mo+` program name to `+phonebook.mo+`.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "phonebook": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/phonebook/public/index.js"
      },
      "main": "src/phonebook/*phonebook.mo*"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "output": "canisters/"
    },
    "start": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8000,
      "serve_root": "canisters/phonebook/assets"
    }
  },
}
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.
////

== Modify the default template program

You have already seen that creating a new project creates a default `+src+` directory with a template `+main.mo+` file.
In this tutorial, you will create a new `+main.mo+` file for the simple phone number lookup program.

To modify the default template source code:

. Open the `+src/phonebook/main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+main.mo+` file:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$phonebook.mo[]
----

== Build and deploy the program

You now have a program that you can compile into an executable WebAssembly module that you can deploy on your local client network.

To build the program executable:

. Change to the root directory for your project, if necessary.
+ 
For example, if your project root directory is `+~/ic-projects/phonebook+`, run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects/phonebook
----
. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build --skip-frontend
----
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
When you run the `+dfx start+` command without the `+--background+` option, the processes start in the current terminal so you need to open a new terminal shell to continue.
. Open a new terminal shell, then change the root directory for your project.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects/phonebook
----
. Deploy your `+phonebook+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install phonebook 
----

== Add names and numbers using the insert function

You now have a program deployed as a *canister* on your local client network and can test your program by using `+dfx canister call+` commands.

To test the program you have deployed on the local client network:

. Use the `+dfx canister call+` command to call the canister `+phonebook+` using the `+insert+` function and pass it a name and phone number by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook insert '("Chris Lynn", "01 415 792 1333")'
----
. Add a second name and number pair by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook insert '("Maya Garcia", "01 408 395 7276")'
----
. Verify that the command returns the number associated with "Chris Lynn" using the `+lookup+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("Chris Lynn")'
----
+
The command returns output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
(opt "01 415 792 1333")
----
+
. Try to call the `+lookup+` function with the number associated with "Maya Garcia" by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("01 408 395 7276")'
----
+
Note that, in this case, the command returns (none) because the phone number is not a key associated with the "Maya Garcia" name entry.
. Try to call the `+lookup+` function again to return the phone numbers for both "Maya Garcia" and "Chris Lynn" by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("Maya Garcia","Chris Lynn")'
----
+
Because the program is written to return one value for one key, the command only returns the phone number associated with the first key—the "Maya Garcia" name entry.
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(opt "01 408 395 7276")
----

== Stop the local network

. Stop the {IC} processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----

== Revise the source code in your program

To extend what you have learned in this tutorial, you might want to try modifying the source code to return different results.

For example, you might want to change the source code so that instead of a program that inserts and looks up a current key-value (name-phone) pair to create a program that stores contact information similar to a database "record" in which a primary key is associated with multiple fields.
In this example, your program might enable users or another program to add information—such as a home phone number, a cell phone number, an email address, and a street address—and selectively return all or specific field values.
