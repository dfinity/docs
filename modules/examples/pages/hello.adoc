# Hello Example

This example demonstrates a dead simple dapp consisting of two canister smart contracts:

* a simple backend canister, ``hello``, implementing the logic of the application, and
* a simple frontend asset canister, ``hello_assets``, serving the assets of the dapp's web user interface.

It is the dapp equivalent of the ubiquitous _hello world_ example.

This example is based on the default project created by running `dfx new` as described in the
link:../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Motoko] and
link:../rust-guide/rust-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Rust] quickstart documents.

The example is available from the
https://github.com/dfinity/examples[examples]
repository in both Motoko and Rust versions:

* https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/hello[Motoko]
* https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/hello[Rust]


Canister ``hello``, whether implemented in Motoko or Rust, presents the same Candid interface:

```candid
service : {
  greet: (text) -> (text);
}
```

The frontend canister, ``hello_assets``, displays an HTML page with a text box for the argument and a button for calling the function greet with that argument.
The result of the call is displayed in a message box.

The frontend canister is a generic canister provided by `dfx` but
the assets it serves to browsers are determined by the dfx project settings and project files.

The frontend canister and its assets are identical for both projects.
