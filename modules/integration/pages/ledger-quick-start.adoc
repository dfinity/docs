[[ledger-intro]]
This _{doctitle}_ guide introduces the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) components for token distribution, transaction management, token-based staking, and payments for services.
The document includes an overview of the design, implementation, security guarantees, system requirements, and the application programming interface (API) that support token management for the Internet Computer Protocol.

_{doctitle}_ is intended as a high-level overview for organizations and developers who need to understand the terminology and overall transaction management flow for Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) tokens.

In reviewing this document, keep in mind that additional details about specific components or interfaces might be available in subsequent documents to supplement the overview provided in this document.
In addition, this overview focuses on how to integrate with the Internet Computer using the link:https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html[Rosetta API]. 
Other options for integration are possible. 
Information about other integration options and procedures might be available in future documentation.

== Basic terminology to get you started

The Internet Computer is primarily a distributed and decentralized platform for running software. 
When developers write applications that run on the Internet Computer, they deploy their programs in the form of a conceptual computational unit called a **canister**. 
A canister is similar to a “smart contract” in that it consists of both program code and state running, replicated, on a block chain network with security and liveness guarantees.

End-users—or other canisters—can send messages to canister functions to perform specific operations. 
The messages can be either **query calls** that retrieve information without saving state or **update calls** that change and preserve state. 
The order in which update are executed is agreed upon order by consensus.

== Ledger canister overview

The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) implements token management using a specialized canister, called the **ledger canister**.
There is a single ledger canister which runs alongside other canisters on the Internet Computer. 
The ledger canister is, in essence, a smart contract that holds **accounts** and **transactions**.
These transactions either **mint ICP tokens** for accounts or **transfer ICP tokens** from one account to another. 
The ledger canister maintains a traceable history of all transactions starting from the genesis state.

=== Accounts

The ledger canister maintains a set of accounts that contain ICP tokens.
Each account on the ledger canister is identified and controlled by a unique identifier called a **principal**. 
For the purpose of this document, one can think of principal identifiers as similar to addresses in Bitcoin or Ethereum: a principal identifier is (roughly) the hash of a user's public key. The corresponding secret key can be used to sign messages and therefore authenticate towards the ledger canister and operate on the principal's account. We remark that canisters may also have accounts with the ledger canister but the related details are outside the scope of this document.
The ledger canister is initialized using administrative operations that are internal to the Internet Computer. 
As part of the initialization process, the canister is created with the set of accounts and associated ICP token balances.


=== Transactions

There are two types of operations that can mutate the internal state of the ledger canister: 

* **Minting ICP tokens** for accounts.
* **Transferring ICP tokens** between accounts. 

All operations are recorded as transactions in the ledger canister. 

The transactions in the ledger are maintained as a hashed block chain.
As state changes are recorded, each new transaction is placed in a block and assigned a unique index. The entire chain is regularly authenticated by signing the latest tip of the chain.  
Queries can use the index to retrieve transaction details. 
The signature used to authenticate a transaction can be verified by any third party who has access to the root public key of the internet Computer.

== Integration via the Rosetta API



The Rosetta API integration is the simplest way to interact with the ledger canister.
If you want to build an exchange for ICP tokens that uses the Rosetta API integration, you don't need to interact with the ledger canister functions directly.

There are a number of ways to interact with the ledger canister on the Internet Computer. In this document we outline how to use the https://www.rosetta-api.org/[Rosetta API] which is a https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html[well-documented and open standard] designed to support multiple block chain data formats and structured communication for exchange workflows.

To make interacting with the internet Computer and ledger canister easy to implement and support, you can download and install integration software that uses the Rosetta application programming interface specification. 
The integration software—`+dfinity/rosetta-api+`—enables you to deploy a passive Rosetta node outside of the Internet Computer network that can communicate with the ledger canister running on the Internet Computer.

The following diagram provides a simplified view of the communication between the Rosetta node and the Internet Computer using the `+dfinity/rosetta-api+` integration software.

image:basic-rosetta-api-integration.svg[]

As this diagram suggests, the Rosetta node maintains a local copy of the {IC} ledger. 
Periodically, the `+dfinity/rosetta-api+` software running on the Rosetta node updates its local view of the ledger by querying the ledger canister for the tip of the ledger chain, then querying for any missing ledger blocks.

=== Basic integration workflow

The following steps summarize the basic operational workflow for transferring ICP tokens if using a Rosetta node to communicate with the Internet Computer ledger canister.  The description assumes a user which controls an IC principal ID using a signing key (stored in a wallet). 

After a user submits a request to the Rosetta node to make a transaction, the request is passed to the integration software running on that node to interact with the {IC} and complete the following steps:

. Read from the local copy of the ledger to determine the state of the latest transaction index and block height identified by the `+latest_index+` label.
. Generate a random `+nonce+` value -- used to ensure unicity of transactions.
. Create an ingress message for the ledger canister that invokes the `+transfer+` function and specifies the amount and the destination for the transaction:
+
....
transfer(nonce, latest_index, dst, amount)
....
. Sign the ingress message using the key stored in the wallet (to identify the principal ID for the owner)
. Forward the message to the ledger canister on the Internet Computer.

=== Setting up a Rosetta node

This section summarizes the steps for how to set up a Rosetta API-compliant node to interact with the Internet Computer and exchange Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) tokens.
To keep the instructions simple, the integration with the Rosetta API is encapsulated in a Docker image.
If you don't already have Docker on your local computer, download and install the latest version.

To set up a Rosetta node for exchanging ICP tokens:

. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Install Docker] and https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/[start the Docker daemon].
+
Typically, an operating system utility starts the Docker daemon (`+dockerd+`) automatically when you reboot your computer. 
If you start the Docker daemon manually, the instructions vary depending on the local operating system.

. Pull the latest `+dfinity/rosetta-api+` image down from Docker Hub by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker pull dfinity/rosetta-api
----

. Start the integration software from the image by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
    --interactive \
    --tty \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --rm \
   dfinity/rosetta-api
----
+
The command starts the software on the local host and displays output similar to the following:
+
....
Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
Starting Rosetta API server
....
+
By default, the software connects to the ledger canister running on the Internet Computer production network.
+
If you have been assigned a test network and corresponding ledger canister identifier, you can run the command against that network by specifying an additional `+canister+` argument. For example, the following command illustrates connecting to the ledger canister on a test network by setting the `+canister+` argument to `+2xh5f-viaaa-aaaab-aae3q-cai+`.
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
    --interactive \
    --tty \
    --publish 8080:8080 \
    --rm \
   dfinity/rosetta-api
   --canister 2xh5f-viaaa-aaaab-aae3q-cai
----
+

NOTE: The first time you run the command it might take some time for the node to catch up to the current tip of the chain.
When the node is caught up, you should see output similar to the following:
+
....
You are all caught up to block height 109
....
+
After completing this step, the node continues to run as a **passive** node that does not participate in block making.
. Open a new terminal window or tab and run the `ps` command to verify the status of the service.
+
If you need to stop the service—for example, to change the canister identifier you are using—you can interrupt the process by pressing CONTROL-C.
+
If you want to test the integration after setting up the node, you will need to write a program to simulate a principal submitting a transaction or looking up an account balance.

=== Running the Rosetta node in production

After sufficient testing, you should run the Docker image in production mode without the `+--interactive+`, `+--tty+`, and `+--rm+` command-line options. 
These command-line options to used to attach an interactive terminal session and remove the container and are primarily intended for testing purposes.

To run the software in a production environment, you might instead start the Docker image using the `+--detach+` option to run the container in the background and, optionally, specify the `+--volume+` for storing blocks.

For more information about Docker command-line options, see the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[Docker documentation].

=== Requirements and limitations

The integration software provided in the Docker image has one requirement that is not part of the standard Rosetta API specification. 
For transactions involving ICP tokens, the unsigned transaction must be created less than 24 hours before the network receives the signed transaction. The reason is that the '+created_at+' field of each transaction refers to an existing transaction (essentially last_index available locally at the time of transaction creation). For efficiency reasons any submitted transaction which refers to a transaction which is too old, is rejected.

Other than this requirement, the Rosetta API integration software is fully-compliant with all standard Rosetta endpoints and passes all of the `+rosetta-cli+` tests. 
The software can accept any valid Rosetta request. 
However, the integration software only prompts for transactions to be signed using Ed25519, rather than https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/models/SignatureType.html#values[all the signature schemes listed here] and only replies with a small subset of the potential responses that the specification supports. For example, the software doesn't implement any of the UTXO features of Rosetta, so you won't see any UTXO messages in any of the software responses.

=== Basic properties for ICP tokens

The ICP token is very similar to Bitcoin. 
For example:

* Each ICP token is divisible 10^8 times.
* All transactions are stored in the ledger starting with the genesis initial state.
* Tokens are entirely fungible.
* Account identifiers are 23 bytes and derived from a public key.

The ICP token differs from Bitcoin however in a few small ways.
For example:

* Rather than using proof of work, staked participant nodes use a variant of threshold BLS signatures to agree on a valid state of the chain.
* Any transaction can store an 8-byte memo -- this is the field which is used by the Rosetta API to store the nonce which disambiguates between transactions; other uses are also possible.

== Ledger canister API reference

In the previous sections, we outline how to integrate with the ledger canister via the Rosetta API. 
For your reference, this section provides information about the ledger canister interfaces. You can also use this information to help you plan for interacting with the ledger canister, directly, if you choose not to use the integration based on the Rosetta API.

The ledger canister provides the following update and query application programming interfaces.

NOTE: The ledger canister interfaces described in this document are preliminary and subject to change.

=== init

Initializes the canister with the set of accounts and associated ICP token balances as described in <<Accounts>>.

....
init : [(PrincipalID, Amount)] -> ()
....

The `+init+` method takes a list of the initial state of balances for individual principal IDs.
The ledger represents this state as a series of `+mint+` operations of the form `+(Mint(dst, amount))+`
The `+init+` method is the only way to create tokens and is only invoked once when the ledger canister is created.

=== transfer

Creates a payment from the caller's principal to the specified recipient with the specified amount.
After the `+init+` operation, the `+transfer+` method is the only method that changes the state of the canister. 

....
update transfer: (
memo: u64, 
created_at: Option<BlockHeight>
dst: Principal ID, 
amount: Amount,
) -> Transaction Index
....

[width="90%",cols="<15%,<75%",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description
|`+memo+` |Allows the caller to set an optional value to identify and link transactions for applications that communicate with the ledger canister.

|`+created_at+` |Provides an optional parameter to reference an already existing transaction.

|`+dst+` |Specifies the destination accounts for the transaction.

|`+amount+` |Specifies the amount is the amount of ICP token to be transferred.

|===

The account of the principal who invokes the transaction is the source (`+src+`) of the transfer.
The transfer succeeds if `+balances[src]+` is greater than the `+amount+`. 
If the transfer succeeds, the canister returns a unique index for the transaction and records the transaction in the ledger like this:

....
(memo, created_at, timestamp, Send(src, dst, amount))
....

The method succeeds only if:

- `+created_at+` is not a block height that is more than 24 hours old.
- `+(memo, created_at,timestamp, Send(src, dst,amount))+` is not already recorded as a transaction at any height greater than `+created_at+`.

Together, these conditions allow the ledger canister to efficiently ensure the uniqueness of each transaction.

=== lookup

Returns the transaction identified uniquely by the transaction index assigned to it.

....
query lookup : Transaction Index -> Option<Hashed Transaction>
....
	 
=== last

Returns the index of the most recent transaction.

....
query last: () -> Option<(Transaction Index, Certification)>
....

=== account_balance

Returns the balance of a specific account.

....
query account_balance : (pid: Principal ID) -> Balance
....
////
=== Data structures

The data structures of the ledger canister are as follows:

....
memo = u64
amount = u64 (100,000,000 == 1 ICP)
created_at = Block Height ( = u64 )
timestamp = u64 (ledger time)

Transaction = Send {
from : Principal ID,
to : Principal ID,
amount : Amount,
}

Transaction = Mint {
to : Principal ID,
amount : Amount
}

Hashed Transaction = (Hash(Previous Hash, Transaction), Transaction)
Ledger = Vec <Hashed Transaction>
....
