The Fundamentals video series provides an introduction to building applications for the Internet Computer.

== Building on the {IC}: Fundamentals

The Fundamentals video series provides an introduction to building applications for the Internet Computer.
The series consists of ten video segments. 
Most of the segments have a running time of three to five minutes, but there are also deeper technical dives that explore the {proglang} programming language, front-end development, and how all of the pieces come together in a sample application.
