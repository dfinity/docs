[[quick-start-intro]]
This {sdk-long-name} provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you create programs to run on a *locally-deployed* {IC} network.
This _Quick start_ assumes that you are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time.

////
IMPORTANT: For this release, only *macOS* and *Linux* platforms are supported.

By developing programs that run on the {platform}, you can deploy secure, tamper-proof applications and provide web-based services without the restrictions or expense of a proprietary infrastructure, the complexities of database management and maintenance, or the investment in hardware required to run enterprise-scale software.

If you want to learn more about the {platform} and how it can transform distributed computing and the application landscape, check out link:https://dfinity.org/faq[Frequently Asked Questions] or the videos posted on the https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOyguKlTxoDK3HRzmGbLyAg[DFINITY Official Youtube Channel].
////

To get started, let's build and deploy a simple Hello application that has just one function—called `+greet+`. The `+greet+` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello,{nbsp}everyone!** in a terminal if you run the application using the command-line or in an alert pop-up window if you access the application in a browser.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install this release of the {sdk-short-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer or how to install `node.js`, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers].
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Download and install>>.

[[download-and-install]]
== Download and install

You can download the latest version of the {sdk-long-name} directly from within a terminal shell on your local computer.

To download and install:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download and install the {sdk-short-name} package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) and its dependencies on your local computer.
. Type `+y+` and press kbd:[Return] to continue with the installation.
+
The command displays information about the components being installed on the local computer.

[[verify-the-sdk-is-ready-to-use]]
== Verify the SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the {platform} will be available on your local computer.

To verify the SDK is ready to use:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Check that you have the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) installed and the `+dfx+` executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the `+dfx+` command-line executable similar to the following:
+
....
dfx 0.6.8
....
. Preview usage information for the other `+dfx+` command-line sub-commands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----
+
The command displays usage information for the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

include::example$vscode-plugin.adoc[]

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You create projects using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.
Creating a new project with `+dfx+` adds a default project directory structure to your development workspace with template files to get you started.

To create a new project for your first application:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----
+
The `+dfx new hello+` command creates a new `+hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+hello+` Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

[[start-the-local-network]]
== Start the local network

Before you can build your first project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

As a best practice, this step requires you to have **two terminal shells** open, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new second terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/hello+` in the new terminal if your `+hello+` project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have **two terminals** open with your **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer in your second terminal by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed.
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
. Leave the terminal window that displays network operations open and switch your focus to the first terminal window where you created your new project.
+
You perform all of the remaining project-related steps in this terminal.

[[register-ids]]
== Register canister identifiers

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register with the network to generate unique canister identifiers for your project.

To register canister identifiers for the local network:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Register unique canister identifiers for the `+hello+` project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----

[[build-the-project]]
== Build the program

Your new `+hello+` project includes a simple default program in the `+src/hello+` directory that you can compile.

To build the program executable:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Ensure that `+node+` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----
+
For more information about this step, see link:../developers-guide/webpack-config{outfilesuffix}#troubleshoot-node[Ensuring node is available in a project].
. Build the executable from the default main program file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Verify the command displays output indicating that the build is successful.
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
....
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
....

[[deploy]]
== Deploy your program locally

The `+dfx build+` command created several artifacts in a `canisters` directory for your project.
You now have a compiled program that can be deployed on your local {IC} network.

To deploy locally:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Deploy the default program on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----
+
You should see an installation confirmation message for your canister similar to the following:
+
....
Installing code for canister hello, with canister_id 75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
Installing code for canister hello_assets, with canister_id cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
....
. Call the predefined `+greet+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello greet everyone
----
+
This example uses the `+dfx canister call+` command to pass "everyone" as an argument to the `+greet+` function.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....

[[quickstart-frontend]]
== Test the application front-end

Now that you have verified that your application has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let's verify that you can access the front-end pop-up window using your web browser.

. Open a browser.
. Navigate to the default address and port number `+127.0.0.1:8000+`, then append `+/?canisterId=+` and the `+hello_assets+` identifier to the URL.
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
....
+
Navigating to this URL displays the prompt pop-up window.
For example:
+
image:quickstart-prompt.png[Prompt pop-up window]

. Type a greeting, then click *OK* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:quickstart-return.png[Hello, everyone! greeting]
. Click *OK* to close the alert pop-up window.

== Stop the local network

After testing the application in the browser, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the local {IC} network running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
