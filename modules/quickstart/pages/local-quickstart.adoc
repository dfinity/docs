[[quick-start-intro]]
This _Quick Start_ scenario assumes that you are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time and are running the {IC} as part of your *local development environment*.

To get started, let's build and deploy a simple Hello application that has just one function—called `+greet+`. The `+greet+` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello,{nbsp}everyone!** in a terminal if you run the application using the command-line or in an HTML page if you access the application in a browser.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install this release of the {sdk-short-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local **macOS** or **Linux** computer.
+
Currently, the {sdk-short-name} only runs on computers with a macOS or Linux operating system.

* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.

This tutorial assumes you know how to perform common tasks—like opening a terminal and running commands—on your computer.
If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer or how to install `node.js`, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers].
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Download and install>>.

[[download-and-install]]
== Download and install

You can download the latest version of the {sdk-long-name} directly from within a terminal shell on your local computer.

To download and install:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download and install the {sdk-short-name} package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) and its dependencies on your local computer.
. Type `+y+` and press kbd:[Return] to continue with the installation.
+
The command displays information about the components being installed on the local computer.

[[verify-the-sdk-is-ready-to-use]]
== Verify the SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the {platform} will be available on your local computer.

To verify the SDK is ready to use:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Check that you have the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) installed and the `+dfx+` executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the `+dfx+` command-line executable similar to the following:
+
....
dfx 0.7.2
....
. Preview usage information for the other `+dfx+` command-line sub-commands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----
+
The command displays usage information for the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

//include::example$vscode-plugin.adoc[]

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You create projects using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

For this tutorial, we'll start with the default sample application to illustrate creating an application using the starter files in a project.
When you create a new project, the `+dfx+` command-line interface adds a default project directory structure to your workspace. We cover the template files that make up a project directory in the link:../developers-guide/tutorials/explore-templates{outfilesuffix}[Explore the default project] tutorial.

To create a new project for your first application:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----
+
The `+dfx new hello+` command creates a new `+hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+hello+` Git repository for your project.
+
If you use a different project name instead of `+hello+`, make note of the name you used. You'll need to use that project name in place of the `+hello+` project name throughout these instructions.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

[[start-the-local-network]]
== Start the local network

Before you can build your first project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a subnet that you can access.

These instructions assume you are running the {IC} locally. If you are connecting to an external {IC} network, you can skip this section. 

As a best practice, this step requires you to have **two terminal shells** open, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new second terminal window or tab on your local computer.
. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary.
+
You should now have **two terminals** open with your **project directory** as your **current working directory** in both terminals.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer in your second terminal by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed.
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
. Leave the terminal window that displays network operations open and switch your focus to the first terminal window where you created your new project.
+
You perform the remaining steps in the terminal that doesn't display network operations.

[[register-ids]]
== Register, build, and deploy the application

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your application locally.

To deploy your first application locally:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Ensure that `+node+` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----
+
For more information about this step, see link:../developers-guide/webpack-config{outfilesuffix}#troubleshoot-node[Ensuring node is available in a project].
. Register, build, and deploy your first application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
For example, this step registers two network-specific identifiers—one for the `+hello+` main program and one for the `+hello_assets+` front-end user interface—and installation information similar to the following:
+
....
Creating the "default" identity.
  - generating new key at /Users/pubs/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem

....
+
If you created a project with a different name, however, your canister names will match your project name instead of `+hello+` and `+hello_assets+`.
+
You should also note that the *first time you deploy*, `+dfx+` creates a `+default+` identity and a local cycle wallet controlled by your `+default+` identity.
A cycles wallet is a special type of canister that enables you to transfer link:../developers-guide/concepts/tokens-cycles{outfilesuffix}[cycles] to other canisters.
+
*To deploy this sample application locally*, you don't need to know anything about your default developer identity, using a cycles wallet, or managing cycles. We'll cover these topics later, but for now, just note that these are created for you automatically. 
. Call the `+hello+` canister and the predefined `+greet+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello greet everyone
----
+
Let's take a closer look at this example command:
+
--

* The `+dfx canister call+` command requires you to specify a canister name and a method—or function—to call.
* `+hello+` specifies the name of the *canister* you want to call.
* `+greet+` specifies the name of the *function* you want to call in the `+hello+` canister.
* `+everyone+` is the text data type argument that you want to pass to the `+greet+` function.
--

+
Remember, however, that if you created a project with a different name, the canister name will match your project name and you'll need to modify the command line to match the name you used instead of `+hello+`.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....

[[quickstart-frontend]]
== Test the application front-end

Now that you have verified that your application has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let's verify that you can access the front-end using your web browser.

. Open a browser.
. Navigate to the default address and port number `+127.0.0.1:8000+`.
. Append `+/?canisterId=+` and the `+hello_assets+` identifier to the URL.
+
If you didn’t make a note of the canister identifier, you can look it up by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister id hello_assets
----
+
Add the canister identifier returned to the URL using the following syntax:
....
?canisterId=<YOUR-ASSET-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER>
....
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai
....
+
Navigating to this URL displays a simple HTML page with a sample asset image file, an input field, and a button.
For example:
+
image:front-end-prompt.png[Sample HTML page]

. Type a greeting, then click *Click Me* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:front-end-result.png[Hello, everyone! greeting]

== Stop the local network

After testing the application in the browser, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the local {IC} network running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
