The {platform} is poised to help you start a revolution with a new way to design, build, and release software.

== Developing open internet services

Conceptually, the Internet Computer is an extension of the existing internet that enables a global network of computers to provide the computing power for running application software.

In much the same way that the adoption of the transport control protocol (TCP) and Internet protocol (IP) provided rules for transferring data between endpoints that helped to establish the “network of networks” that we know as the internet of today, the {IC} relies on a decentralization protocol called the {IC} protocol to define the software components that enable a global network of computers to combine their resources to read, replicate, modify, and return application state.

== Developer workflow at-a-glance

At a high-level, there are three possible workflows for building applications that run on the {IC}.

The first path is the most common: you connect to the Internet Computer running locally or on a remote network, then write, compile, and deploy in an iterative cycle. 

If you prefer to do all of your development work disconnected from the network, you can follow the second path and only connect to the network when you are ready to compile and deploy.

In the third path, you connect to the Internet Computer running locally or on a remote network, then register for a unique identifier before you have a program ready to compile. 
With this option, you can preregister with the network to receive a unique identifier, then compile and deploy using a known identifier when you are ready to move your application to the network.
