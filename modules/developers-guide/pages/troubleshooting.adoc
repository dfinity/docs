This section provides information to help you troubleshoot and resolve or work around common issues that are related to the following tasks:

* downloading and installing the {sdk-short-name}
* creating, building, or deploying canisters
* using the `+dfx+` command-line interface
* running the {IC} network locally in a development environment

== Migrating an existing project

Currently, there is no automatic migration or backward compatibility for any projects that you might have created using previous versions of the `+dfx+` command-line interface.
After upgrading to the latest version, you might see error or failure messages if you attempt to build or install a project created with a previous version of the `+dfx+` command-line interface.

In many cases, however, you can continue to work with projects from a previous release by manually changing the dfx setting in the dfx.json configuration file, then rebuilding the project to be compatible with the version of the `+dfx+` command-line interface you have currently installed.

For example, if you have a project that was created with `+dfx+` version `+0.4.9+`, open the `+dfx.json+` file in a text editor and change the `+dfx+` setting to the latest version or remove the section entirely.

== Restarting the local {IC} network

In some cases, starting the {IC} network locally fails because of replicated state errors. 
If you encounter issues when running `+dfx start+` to start the local {IC} network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
. Restart the {IC} in a clean state by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --clean
----
+
The `+--clean+` option removes checkpoints and stale state information from your project's cache so that you can restart the {IC} replica and web server processes in a clean state.

Keep in mind, however, that if you reset the state information by running `+dfx start --clean+`, your existing canisters are also removed. 

After running +dfx start --clean+`, recreate your canisters by running the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
dfx build
dfx canister install --all
----

== Reinstalling dfx

Many of the bugs you might encounter can be addressed by uninstalling and reinstalling the `+dfx+` command-line interface.
Here are a few ways to reinstall `+dfx+`:

[source,bash]
----
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity && rm $(which dfx) && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----

== Xcode prerequisite

Some versions of the {sdk-short-name} prompted you to install Xcode when creating a new project on a macOS computer.
The prompt has been removed and the `+dfx new+` command does not require you to install any macOS developer tools.
However, you should have Developer Command Line Tools installed if you want to create a Git repository for your project.

You can check whether you have the developer tools installed by running `+xcode-select -p+`.
You can install the developer tools by running `+xcode-select --install+`.

== Failed build when using VMs

If you are running `+dfx+` using a virtual machine image on Ubuntu or CentOS, you might see an error message that looks like this when you attempt to run the `+dfx build+` command:

[source,bash]
-----
Building hello...
An error occured:
Io(
    Os {
        code: 2,
        kind: NotFound,
        message: "No such file or directory",
    },
)
-----

== Handling orphan processes

The dfx execution tool runs multiple processes.
Sometimes the processes do not get properly terminated.
If you encounter an issue where you suspect or you receive a message that a process is already running in the background, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pkill replica nodemanager dfx
----

== Memory leak

Fixing memory leaks is an ongoing process. If you encounter any error messages related to memory leaks, you should do the following:

. Run `+dfx stop+` to stop currently running processes.
. Uninstal `+dfx+` to prevent further degradation.
. Re-install `+dfx+`
. Run `+dfx start+` to restart replica processes.

Alternatively, you can remove the `+.cache/dfinity+` directory and re-install the latest `+dfx+` binary.
For example:
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.cache/dfinity && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
