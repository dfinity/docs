= Token Transfer Sample Code

Token Transfer is a canister that can transfer tokens from its account to other accounts. It is an example of a canister that uses the Ledger canister and is useful for any financial integration or defi dapps that you may like to build. Sample code is available in https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/ledger-transfer[Motoko] and https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/tokens_transfer[Rust].

The sample code revolves around one core `ledger_transfer` function which takes as input the amount of tokens to transfer, the account (and optionally the subaccount) to which to transfer the tokens and returns either success or an error in case e.g. the tokens transfer canister doesn't have enough tokens to do the transfer. In case of success, a unique identifier of the transaction is returned. This identifier will be stored in the memo of the transaction in the Ledger.

// This example demonstrates an application that transfer ICPs to its most active users.

// == Prerequisites

// Verify the following before running this demo:

// *  You have downloaded and installed the [DFINITY Canister SDK](https://smartcontracts.org).

// *  You have stopped any Internet Computer or other network process that would create a port conflict on 8000.

// == Demo

// 1. Follow the [Ledger: Deploying locally](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/rosetta-api/ledger_canister#deploying-locally) guide to install the ICP ledger canister locally.

// ----

// 1. Post a message as a new user
