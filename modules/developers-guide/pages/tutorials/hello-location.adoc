This tutorial provides a simple variation on the default program that lets you pass a single string argument to a single actor, compile the code to create a canister, then retrieve the argument.

This tutorial illustrates how to pass arguments on the command-line in a terminal using the Candid interface description language (IDL) and how to modify the program to allow it to accept more than one value for the string argument.

== Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].
* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new location_hello
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd location_hello
----

== Modify the default configuration

In the link:explore-templates{outfilesuffix}[Exploring the default project] tutorial, you saw that creating a new project adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to your project directory.
You should always review the default settings in the file to verify the information accurately reflects the project settings you want to use.
For this tutorial, you'll modify the default configuration to remove settings that aren't used.

To modify settings in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
. Check the default settings for the `+location_hello+` project.
+
. Remove all of the unnecessary configuration settings.
+
Because this tutorial does not involve creating any front-end assets, you can remove all of the `+location_hello_assets+` configuration settings from the file.
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Modify the default program

In the link:explore-templates{outfilesuffix}[Exploring the default project] tutorial, you saw that creating a new project creates a default `+src+` directory with a template `+main.mo+` file.

To modify the default template source code:

. Open the `+src/location_hello/main.mo+` source code file in a text editor.
. Modify the default source code to replace the `+greet+` function with a `+location+` function and the `+name+` argument with a `+city+` argument.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
include::example$location_hello.mo[]
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Start the local network

Before you can build your project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

As a best practice, this step requires you to have two terminal shells open, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the local network:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/location_hello+` in the new terminal if your `+location_hello+` project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have **two terminals** open with your **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. 
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your project.

== Register canister identifiers

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register with the network to generate unique, network-specific *canister identifiers* for your project.

To register canister identifiers for the local network:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Register unique canister identifiers for the canisters in the project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----
+
The command displays the network-specific canister identifier for the canister defined in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
....
  "location_hello" canister created with canister id: "ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D"
....

== Build and deploy the program

You now have a simple program that you can compile into an executable WebAssembly module, then deploy as a canister on your local {IC} network.

To build and deploy the program executable:

. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Deploy your `+location_hello+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install location_hello
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
Installing code for canister location_hello, with canister_id ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D
....

== Pass a string argument

You now have a program deployed as a *canister* on your local {IC} network and can test your program by using `+dfx canister call+` commands.

To test the program you have deployed locally:

. Call the `+location+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument of type `+string+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call location_hello location "San Francisco"
----
+
Because the argument in this case includes a space between `+San+` and `+Francisco+`, you need to enclose the argument in quotes. 
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
("Hello, San Francisco!")
....
+
If the argument did not contain a space that required enclosing the text inside of quotation marks, you could allow the Candid interface description language to infer the data type like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call location_hello location Paris
----
. Call the `+location+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument explicitly using the Candid interface description language syntax for Text arguments:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call location_hello location '("San Francisco and Paris")'
----
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
("Hello, San Francisco and Paris!")
....
+ 
Because your program only accepts a single string argument, specifying multiple strings returns only the first argument or a `+mismatch+` error.
+
For example, if you try this command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call location_hello location '("San Francisco","Paris","Rome")'
----
+
Only the first argument—`+("Hello, San Francisco!")+`—is returned or you'll see an error similar to the following:
+
....
Invalid data: Unable to serialize Candid values: length mismatch for types and values
....

== Revise the source code in your program

To extend what you have learned in this tutorial, you might want to try modifying the source code to return different results.
For example, you might want to modify the `+location+` function to return multiple city names.

To experiment with modifying the source code for this tutorial:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor and change the default `+location_hello+` settings to `+favorite_cities+`.
. Save your changes and close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.
. Copy the `+location_hello+` source file directory to match the name specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -r src/location_hello src/favorite_cities
----
. Open the `+src/favorite_cities/main.mo+` file in a text editor.
. Copy and paste the following code sample to replace the `+location+` function with two new functions.
+
For example:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$favorite_cities.mo[]
----
+
You might notice that `+Text+` in this code example is enclosed by square (`+[ ]+`) brackets. By itself, `+Text+` represents a collection of UTF-8 characters. 
The square brackets around a type indicate that it is an *array* of that type.
In this context, therefore, `+[Text]+` indicates an array of a collection of UTF-8 characters, enabling the program to accept and return multiple text strings.
+
The code sample also uses the basic format of an `+apply+` operation for the array, which can be abstracted as:
+
....
public func apply<A, B>(fs : [A -> B], xs : [A]) : [B] {
    var ys : [B] = [];
    for (f in fs.vals()) {
      ys := append<B>(ys, map<A, B>(f, xs));
    };
    ys;
};
....
+
For information about the functions that perform operations on arrays, see the description of the Array module in the {proglang} base library or the _{proglang} Programming Language Reference_.
. Register a network-specific identifier for the new program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create favorite_cities
----
+
The command returns output similar to the following:
+
....
"favorite_cities" canister created with canister id: "ic:02000000000000000000000000000000000153"
....
. Build the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
For this tutorial, you have already removed the front-end assets canister, so running `+dfx build+` only compiles the `+favorite_cities+` canister. 
You can also build projects using the optional `+--skip-frontend+` argument if you are only interested in compiling back-end code for a project.
. Deploy your `+favorite_cities+` program on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install favorite_cities
----
. Call the `+location+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument using the Candid interface description syntax by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call favorite_cities location '(vec {"San Francisco";"Paris";"Rome"})'
----
+
The command uses the Candid interface description syntax `+(vec { val1; val2; val3; })+` to return a vector of values.
For more information about the Candid interface description syntax, see link:../cli-reference{outfilesuffix}#idl-syntax[Interface description syntax for arguments].
+
This command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
("Hello, from ["San Francisco", "Paris", "Rome"]!")
....
. Call the `+location_pretty+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument using the interface description syntax by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call favorite_cities location_pretty '(vec {"San Francisco";"Paris";"Rome"})'
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
("Hello from San Francisco, Paris, Rome, bon voyage!")
....

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
