= 5. Deploying On-chain (1 min)

== 5.1 Deploy the Dapp On-chain via dfx (Terminal B)

Now that you have your link:developers-guide/concepts/tokens-cycles[cycles] and your `dfx` is configured to transfer cycles, you are now ready to deploy your `Hello` dapp on-chain.

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network ic --with-cycles 1000000000000
----

The `--network` option specifies the network alias or URL for deploying the dapp. This option is required to install on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet. `--with-cycles` explicitly tells `dfx` how many cycles to use, otherwise it will use the default of 3 trillion.

If successful, your terminal should look like this: 

[source,bash]

----

Note the bottom of the message which returns the URL where you can see your canister's frontend deployed on-chain: https://5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.ic0.app/

In the example above, we created a `Hello` dapp that is composed of two canisters: 

a. `hello` canister `5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai` which contains the backend logic.

b. `hello_assets` canister `5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai` which contains the frontend assets (e.g. HTML, JS, CSS).

== 5.2 See your Dapp Live On-chain via a Browser

Navigate to and enter a name: https://5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.ic0.app/

Before your dapp loads, your browser will quickly show a message that reads: Installing "Internet Computer Validating Service Worker". This link:https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/service-worker-overview/[service worker] comes from the IC and it is used to make sure the web app the user sees is the correct, untampered frontend. Once loaded, your browser will cache the service worker and your web app will load much quicker.

After loading the service worker, your dapp will load: 

image:front-end-result.png[Hello, everyone! greeting]

== 5.3 Testing the On-chain Dapp via the Command Line (Terminal B)

Since the canister has a method called `greet` (which accepts a string as a parameter), we can send it a message via `dfx`.

[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network ic call hello greet '("everyone": text)'
----

Note the way the message is constructed:

* `dfx canister --network ic call` is setup for calling a canister on the IC.

* `hello greet` means we are sending a message to a canister named `hello` and evoking its `greet` method. `dfx` knows which `hello` canister (out of the many in the IC), one refers to because a mapping of `hello` to a canister id is stored locally in `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`.

* `'("everyone": text)'` is the parameter we are sending to `greet` (which accepts `Text` as its only input).

== Conclusion

You have now deployed the dapp on-chain! You can read the conclusion of the tutorial.

== Troubleshooting

=== 403 Error

If you receive a 403 error, it is possible the identity you are using does not have enough cycles. You should try the following to debug:

== 1. Confirm you are using the identity you assume are using

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity whoami
----

== 2. Confirm the identity you are using has enough cycles on-chain

[source,bash]
----
dfx wallet --network ic balance
----

== 3. Try proxying through your wallet

Sometimes (especially when you created the canisters with `dfx` versions before 0.9.0) your wallet is set as your canister's controller. To have your wallet be the source of the deployment instruction, add the flag `--wallet <insert-your-wallet-id-here>` to the deploy or call command.

If this works and you would like to add your own principal as a controller of the canister (so you don't have to use the `--wallet` option anymore), you can run this:

[source, bash]
----
dfx canister --wallet "$(dfx identity get-wallet)" update-settings --all --add-controller "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
----
