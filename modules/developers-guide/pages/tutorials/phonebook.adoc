In this tutorial, you are going to write a simple program that enables you to store and look up telephone numbers. 
This tutorial illustrates how to import and use a few basic {proglang} library functions.

For this tutorial, the {proglang} base library functions are defined in the  `+List+` and `+AssocList+` modules and enable you to work with lists as linked key-value pairs. 
In this example, the *key* is a `+name+` and the *value* is the `+phone+` text string associated with that name. 

This program supports the following function calls:

* The `+insert+` function accepts the `+name+` and `+phone+` key-value pair as input stored in the `+book+` variable.
* The `+lookup+` function is a query that uses the specified `+name+` key as input to find the associated phone number.

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].
* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

== Creating a new project

To create a new project for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already
have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Creating a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new phonebook
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd phonebook
----

== Modify the default program

For this tutorial, let's create a new `+main.mo+` file for the simple phone number lookup program.

To modify the default template:

. Open the `+src/phonebook/main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+main.mo+` file:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$phonebook.mo[]
----
+
In looking at this sample program, you might notice the following key elements:
+
--

* The code defines `+Name+` and `+Phone+` as custom Text types.
Creating user-defined types improves the readability of the code.

* The `+insert+` function is an update call and the `+lookup+` function is a query call.

* The `+Phone+` type is identified as an optional value by using the `+?Phone+` syntax.
-- 

== Start the local network

Before you can build the `+phonebook+` project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.

* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/phonebook+` in the new terminal if your project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have two terminals open with your project directory as your current working directory.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
After you start the local network, this terminal displays messages about network operations.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project.

== Register canister identifiers

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register with the network to generate unique canister identifiers for your project.

To register canister identifiers for the local network:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Register unique canister identifiers for the project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----
+
The command displays the network-specific canister identifiers for the canisters defined in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
....
"phonebook" canister created with canister id: "ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D"
"phonebook_assets" canister created with canister id: "ic:02000000000000000000000000000000000153"
....
+
Keep in mind that because you are running the {ic} locally, these identifiers are only valid on the local network.
To deploy canisters on a remote network, you must connect to that network using the `+--network+` command-line option and a specific network name or address to register identifiers on that network.

== Build and deploy the program

Now that you have registered with the network, you are ready to compile your program into an executable WebAssembly module that you can then deploy on your local {IC} network.

To build and deploy the program:

. Check that you are still in your project directory by running the `+pwd+` command, if necessary.
. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build --skip-frontend
----
The `+dfx.json+` file provides default settings for creating an application front-end entry point and `+assets+` canister. 
For this tutorial, however, you can build your project using the `+--skip-frontend+` option because the project is a terminal-based application that doesn't include any front-end assets.
+
Although this tutorial illustrates how to skip compiling a front-end canister, you can add a simple user interface to this application later by exploring the link:https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/phone-book[phone-book] project in the link:https://github.com/dfinity/examples[examples] repository.
. Deploy your `+phonebook+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install phonebook 
----

== Add names and numbers using the insert function

You now have a program deployed as a *canister* on your local replica network and can test your program by using `+dfx canister call+` commands.

To test the program you have deployed on the local replica network:

. Use the `+dfx canister call+` command to call the canister `+phonebook+` using the `+insert+` function and pass it a name and phone number by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook insert '("Chris Lynn", "01 415 792 1333")'
----
. Add a second name and number pair by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook insert '("Maya Garcia", "01 408 395 7276")'
----
. Verify that the command returns the number associated with "Chris Lynn" using the `+lookup+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("Chris Lynn")'
----
+
The command returns output similar to the following:
+
....
(opt "01 415 792 1333")
....
+
. Try to call the `+lookup+` function with the number associated with "Maya Garcia" by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("01 408 395 7276")'
----
+
Note that, in this case, the command returns `+(null)+` because the phone number is not a key associated with the "Maya Garcia" name entry.
. Try to call the `+lookup+` function again to return the phone numbers for both "Maya Garcia" and "Chris Lynn" by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("Maya Garcia","Chris Lynn")'
----
+
Because the program is written to return one value for one key, the command returns a `+mismatch+` error.
+
....
Invalid data: Unable to serialize Candid values: length mismatch for types and values

== Revise the source code in your program

To extend what you have learned in this tutorial, you might want to try modifying the source code to return different results.

For example, you might want to change the source code so that instead of a program that inserts and looks up a current key-value (name-phone) pair to create a program that stores contact information similar to a database "record" in which a primary key is associated with multiple fields.
In this example, your program might enable users or another program to add information—such as a home phone number, a cell phone number, an email address, and a street address—and selectively return all or specific field values.

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
