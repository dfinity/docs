== Before you begin

Before you start using the {sdk-long-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for {proglang} as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#install-vscode[Install the language editor plug-in] if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE.

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

== Create a new project

As discussed in the link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Quick start], applications for the {IC} start as **projects** that you create projects using the `+dfx+` executable command-line interface (CLI).
.
To take a closer look at the files and folders that are included in a  project by default, let's create a new project to work with.

To create a new project:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a folder for your {IC} sample projects in your home directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/ic-projects
----
. Change to your sample projects folder.
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects
----
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello_world
----
+
The `+dfx new hello_world+` command creates a new `+hello_world+`
project, including a default project directory structure under the new
project name and a new Git repository for your project.
If you have `+node.js+` installed locally, creating a new project also adds some template front-end code and dependencies.
+
To ensure that project names are valid when used in JavaScript, Motoko, and other contexts, you should only use alphanumeric characters and underscores.
You cannot include dashes or any special characters.
+
The command displays output similar to the following excerpt:
+
[source,bash]
----
Fetching manifest https://sdk.dfinity.org/manifest.json
Creating new project "hello_world"...
CREATE       hello_world/src/hello_world/main.mo (107B)...
CREATE       hello_world/dfx.json (320B)...
CREATE       hello_world/.gitignore (189B)...
CREATE       hello_world/README.md (1.01KB)...
CREATE       hello_world/src/hello_world/public/index.js (155B)...
CREATE       hello_world/package.json (263B)...
CREATE       hello_world/webpack.config.js (1.76KB)...
----
. View the default directory structure by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l hello_world
----
+
By default, the project directory structure includes at least one source subdirectory, a template `+README.md+` file, and a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
Depending on whether you have `+node.js+` installed, your project directory might include some or all of the following files:
+
[source,bash]
----
hello_world/
├── README.md      # default project documentation
├── dfx.json       # project configuration file
├── node_modules   # libraries for front-end development
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src            # source files directory
|   └── hello_world
│       ├── main.mo
│       └── public
│           └── index.js
└── webpack.config.js
----
+
At a minimum, the default project directory includes the following folders and files:
+
--
* A default `README` file for documenting your project in the repository.
* A default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to set configurable options for your project.
* A default `+src+` directory for all of the source files required by your application.
--
+
The default `+src+` directory includes a template `+main.mo+` file that you can modify or replace to include your core programming logic.
+
Because this tutorial focuses on the basics of getting started, you are only going to use the `+main.mo+` file. 
If you have `+node.js+` installed, your project directory includes additional files and directories that you can use to define the front-end interface for your application.
Front-end development and the template files in the `+public+` folder are discussed a little later.

== Review the default configuration

By default, creating a new project adds some template files to your project directory.
You can edit these template files to customize the configuration settings for your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle. 

To review the default configuration file for your project:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello_world
----
. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor to review the default settings.
+
For example:
+
[source,json]
----
include::example$sample-dfx.json[]
----
+
Let's take a look at a few of the default settings.
+
--
* The `+canisters+` section specifies the name of the WebAssembly module for your `+hello_world+` project is `+hello_world+`.
* The `+canisters+` section specifies that the main program to be complied is located in the path specified by the `+main+` setting, in this case, `+src/hello_world/main.mo+`.
* The `+defaults+` section specifies the location for `+output+` generated by the `+build+` command—in this case, the `+canisters+` directory—and the default host `+address+` and `+port+` for accessing the compiled output.
* The `+dfx+` and `+version+` settings are used to identify the version of the software used to create the project.
--
+
You can leave the default settings as they are. 
. Close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.

== Review the default program code

New projects always include a template `main.mo` source code file.
You can edit this file to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

Let's take a look at the sample program in the default `main.mo` template file as a starting point for creating simple program using the {proglang} programming language.

To review the default sample program for your project:

. Check that you are still in your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
pwd
----
. Change to the `+src/hello_world+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/hello_world
----
. Open the `+main.mo+` file in a text editor and review the code in the template:
+
[source,bash]
----
actor {
    public func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
        return "Hello, " # name # "!";
    };
};
----
+
Let's take a look at a few key elements of this program:
+
--
* You might notice that this sample code defines an `+actor+` instead of a `+main+` function, which some programming languages require. 
For {proglang}, the `+main+` function is implicit in the file itself.

* Although the traditional "Hello, World!" program illustrates how you can print a string using a `+print+` or `+println+` function, that traditional program would not represent a typical use case for {proglang} programs that run on the {IC}.

* Instead of a print function, this sample program defines an `+actor+` with a public `+greet+` function that takes a `+name+` argument with a type of `+Text+`.

* The program then uses the `+async+` keyword to indicate that the program returns an asynchronous message consisting of a concatenated text string constructed using `+"Hello, "+`, the `+#+` operator, the `+name+` argument, and `+"!"+`.
--
We’ll explore code that uses `+actor+` objects and asynchronous message handling more a little later. 
For now, you can continue to the next section to build the program from the default `+main.mo+` file.
. Close the `+main.mo+` file to continue.

== Build the program

Now that you have explored the default configuration settings and program codes, let's compile the default program into an executable WebAssembly module.

To build the program executable:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Navigate to the root of your `+hello_world+` project folder.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects/hello_world
----
+
Note that this step is required because you must run the `+dfx build+` command from within the project directory structure.
. Build the executable canister by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
The command displays output indicating that the build is successful.
+
For example, if you have `+node.js+` installed you should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Building canisters hello_world
Building frontend
Bundling frontend assets in the canister
----
. Verify that the `+canisters/hello_world+` directory created by the `+build+` command contains the WebAssembly and related application files by running the following command.
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l canisters/hello_world/
----
+
For example, the command returns output similar to the following if you have `+node.js+` installed locally:
+
[source,bash]
----
total 144
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff      8 Jan 28 13:30 _canister.id
drwxr-xr-x  4 pubs  staff    128 Jan 28 13:30 assets
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff     43 Jan 28 13:30 main.did
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff    117 Jan 28 13:30 main.did.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff    155 Jan 28 13:30 main.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff  53420 Jan 28 13:30 main.wasm
----
+
The `canisters/hello_world` directory contains the following key files:
+
--
* The `+_canister.id+` file contains a randomly-generated identifier for your compiled program.

* The `+main.did+` file contains an interface description for your program.

* The `+main.js+` file contains a JavaScript representation of the canister interface for your program. 

* The `+main.wasm+` file contains the compiled WebAssembly for your program.

* If you have `+node.js+` installed, the `+assets+` is created to store your front-end JavaScript, custom CSS, and HTML files. 
--
+
In addition to the files in the `canisters/hello_world` directory, the `+dfx build+` command creates an `+idl_+` directory.

== Start the local network and deploy

You now have a program that can be deployed on your local {ic} network.

To deploy the program on your local network:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open, and navigate to your `+hello_world+` project directory.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed.
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
+
After you start the local network, this terminal displays messages about network operations.
. Open a new terminal and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, if you are in the Terminal application on macOS:
+
* Click Shell, then click *New Window*.
* Navigate to your `+hello_world+` project directory in the new terminal shell before continuing to the next step.
. Deploy your `+hello_world+` project on the local network by running the `+dfx canister install+` command and specifying a `+canister_name+` that matches the canister name specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
For this tutorial, the canister name is `+hello_world+`, so you can deploy the canister by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install hello_world
----
+
The command output displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Installing code for canister hello_world, with canister_id ic:81DDA04F69F40FEEAC
----
. Call the predefined `+greet+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello_world greet "everyone" --type string
----
+
This example uses the `+dfx canister call+` command to pass "everyone" as an argument of type `+string+` to the `+greet+` function.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function (Hello, there!).
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
("Hello, everyone!")
----
. Stop the local {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----

== View the default front-end

If you have `+node.js+` installed in your development environment, your project includes a simple front-end example that uses a template `+index.js+` JavaScript file and a sample `+index.html+` file for accessing the `+hello_world+` program in a browser.

To explore the default front-end template:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open, and navigate to your `+hello_world+` project directory.
. Open the `+src/hello_world/public/index.js+` file in a text editor and review the code in the template script:
+
[source,bash]
----
import hello_world from 'ic:canisters/hello_world';

hello_world.greet(window.prompt("Enter your name:")).then(greeting => {
  window.alert(greeting);
});
----
+
The template `+index.js+` file uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to describe the structure and content of a document on the web.
+
This sample file imports the canister you created and calls the `+greet+` function in a prompt window.
. Close the `+index.js+` file to continue.
. View the static assets created in the `canisters` directory by running following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l canisters/hello_world/assets/
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following if you have `+node.js+` installed.
+
[source,bash]
----
total 24
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff  1191 Jan 28 13:30 index.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff  5524 Jan 28 13:30 index.js.map
----
+
These files were generated automatically by the `+dfx build+` command using node modules and the template `+index.js+` file.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
. Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
By default, the URL uses the localhost address (`+127.0.0.1+`) and port number `+8000+`, so you can navigate to the front-end for the hello_world program using `+127.0.0.1:8000+` for the URL.
+
In addition to the host and port, the URL you specify needs to include `+canisterId+` parameter to identify the canister that you want the web server to display. 
To specify the canister, append the identifier using the following syntax:
+
[source,bash]
----
?canisterId=ic:<YOUR-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER>
----
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=ic:81DDA04F69F40FEEAC
----
. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:hello-world-prompt.png[Hello world prompt window]
. Type a greeting, then click *OK* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:hello-world-return.png[Hello world return string]
. Return to the terminal shell and stop the local {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
