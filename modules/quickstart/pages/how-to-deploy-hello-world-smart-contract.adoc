How to deploy a "hello world" smart contract/dapp in 20 minutes
===============================================================

This is a fast, minimalist tutorial for deploying a "hello world" smart contract or dapp to the IC in 20 minutes or less. All that is necessary to run this tutorial is basic knowledge of using a terminal (no editing of code).

== Introduction

In this tutorial, we will deploy a simple `Hello` dapp accepts text argument as input, and returns the result as a greeting. For example, if you call the `greet` method with the text argument `Everyone`.

See the dapp on-chain: https://6lqbm-ryaaa-aaaai-qibsa-cai.ic0.app/ 

**a. Via the command-line, the dapp will return `Hello, Everyone!` in a terminal**

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx canister call hello greet everyone
$ "Hello, everyone"
----

**b. By accessing the dapp in a browser, it will alert pop-up window reading `Hello, Everyone!`**

While the code comes ready out of the box for you, this dapp consists of back-end code written in Motoko, a programming language specifically designed for interacting with the Internet Computer (IC), and a simple webpack-based front-end. 

== Concepts necessary for this tutorial

* A *canister smart contract/dapp* is a type of smart contract that bundles code and state. As in this tutorial, it is common for a dapp to be composed of multiple canister smart contracts.

* A *cycle* is the unit of measurement for resources consumed in the form of processing, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. For the sake of this tutorial, this is analogous to Ethereum's gas: it is what one needs to run their dapp, yet it is much more stable and less expensive for developers to use. Every canister has a cycles account to which resources consumed by the canister are charged. The Internet Computer's utility token (ICP) can be converted to cycles and transferred to a canister. ICP can always be converted to cycles using the current price of ICP measured in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights[SDR] using the convention that one trillion cycles correspond to one SDR. **In this tutorial, you can get free cycles from the cycles faucet.**

* A *cycles wallet* is a type of canister that holds your cycles for you. You will use this canister to power up your dapps.

== 1. Installing Tools

To build a dapp, you need to install some dependencies.

== 2. Create a Default Project (1 min)

With the SDK installed, you can create a default "hello world" project we will use in this tutorial. This project will have the necessary smart contract and frontend code you will need.

== 3. Deploying Dapp to Local Machine (3 min)

With the project created, you can test it by deploying it to your local machine.

== 4. Acquiring Cycles to Deploy On-chain (10-15 min)

To deploy on-chain, you will need to add cycles to your account.

== 5. Deploying On-chain (1 min)

Now that you have cycles, you can deploy the "hello world" dapp on-chain.

== 6. Conclusion

=== 6.1 Wrap-up: What you have done
You have done the following in this tutorial:

* Installed the Canister SDK
* Built and deployed a dap locally
* Received free cycles for your dapp
* Created a "cycles wallet" that can transfer cycles to any other dapps you want to power
* Deployed your dapp on-chain

=== 6.2 Using your free cycles to power other dapps

You can use the cycles you received earlier for other dapps.
