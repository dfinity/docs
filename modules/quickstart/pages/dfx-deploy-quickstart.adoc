[[preview-intro]]
The {sdk-short-name} release includes a preview of a simplified developer workflow.
As part of our developer community, we encourage you to try out this new workflow and provide us with feedback on your experience. 

The new developer workflow is intended to streamline the development process and make it easier for you to iterate quickly on your application design and implementation.

== Before you begin

The {sdk-short-name} release is built from the same code base as the publicly-available release of the {sdk-long-name}.
However, this version of the software includes features and changes that are not yet supported and might be known to be incomplete or unstable.
In addition, the {sdk-short-name} release is not intended to work with any existing projects you might have previously compiled or deployed.

If possible, you should install the {sdk-short-name} preview release in a completely clean environment with no other versions of the {sdk-long-name} installed.
For information about removing the current software before installing a new release, see link:../developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove{outfilesuffix}#remove[Removing the software] before continuing to <<Download and install>> the {sdk-short-name} release.

Before you download and install the {sdk-short-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

== Getting started

To provide feedback on the simplified developer workflow, you must have the _not publicly promoted_ version of the {sdk-short-name} available on your local computer.

[[download-and-install]]
=== Download and install

To download the {sdk-short-name}, you must specify the version using an environment variable. 

To download and install:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download and install the {sdk-short-name} by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
. Type `+y+` and press kbd:[Return] to accept the license agreement and continue with the installation.
. Verify the {sdk-short-name} is ready to use by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the developer command-line interface similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx 0.6.11
----
. Preview usage information for the developer command-line interface (`+dfx+`) commands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----

[[deploy-hello-world]]
=== Create and deploy Hello, World

After you have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name}, you are ready to create and deploy the default sample application.

The default application consists of one `+greet+` function that accepts one text argument and returns the result in a terminal or in a browser.

To create your first application:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new workflow_hello
----
+
The `+dfx new workflow_hello+` command creates a new project directory with template files and a new Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd workflow_hello
----
. Start the {IC} network locally on your computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
. Register, build, and deploy all of the canisters specified in the default `+dfx.json+` file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
If you have access to the {IC} running remotely, you can deploy to the that network instead of deploying locally by specifying the `+--network+` option and the network alias configured in the `+dfx.json+` file.
For example, you would run a command similar the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network ic
----
+
If prompted, specify the credentials for accessing the {IC}.
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
. Call the predefined `+greet+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call workflow_hello greet '("World")'
----
+
The command displays the following output for the `+greet+` function:
+
....
("Hello, World!")
....
. Copy the canister identifier for the `+workflow_hello_assets+` canister and paste it into a browser to test the `+greet+` function front-end.
+
If you are using the default local host and port, you should have a URL similar to the following:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
....
. Copy the canister identifier for the `+workflow_hello+` canister and paste into a browser using the default local host and port to test the `+greet+` function using the Candid web interface.
+
If you are using the default local host and port, you should have a URL similar to the following:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/candid?canisterId=75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
....
+
After testing the functions, return to the terminal that displays network operations to stop the {IC} network.
. Press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.
. Stop the local {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----

=== Deploying a second application

The `+Hello, World+` example illustrates the basic workflow using a simple predefined sample application.
For a more realistic view of the development process, let's build a second application from scratch.

To keep things simple, let's write a  program that is similar to the default sample application but introduces a few new functions and data types.

==== Create a second application

To create a second sample application:

. Open a new terminal shell and navigate to the working directory you use for {IC} projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new my_counter_hello
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd my_counter_hello
----

==== Modify the default source code

To replace the default application application:

. Open the `+src/my_counter_hello/main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
+
The new program uses a function in the Motoko base library for natural numbers, so the first step is to import the `+Nat+` module.
. Add an `+import+` statement as the first line in your new program:
+
[source,bash]
----
import Nat "mo:base/Nat";
----
. Add variable declarations for `+count+` as a natural number and `+output+` as text:
+
[source,bash]
----
var count: Nat = 0;
var output : Text = "Welcome to the simplified developer preview, ";
----
+
In the next step, we'll create an actor with two simple functions—`+whoami+` and `+get+`—to display a welcome message that takes a text argument and to increment a counter.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+main.mo+` file:
+
[source,motoko]
----
actor HelloActor {

   public func whoami(name: Text) : async Text {
      count += 1; 
      return output # name # ": " # Nat.toText(count)
   };

   public query func get() : async Text {
      return "Your counter value is: " # Nat.toText(count);
   };
};
----
+
In this code sample:
+
--
* The `+whoami+` function increments a counter using the `+count +=1+` expression. 
This operation is a state change, so the `+whoami+` function is an *update* call. 

* The `+get+` function is only used to retrieve the counter value without making any changes to state, so the `+get+` function is a *query* call.

* The `+actor+` returns text, so both the `+whoami+` and `+get+` functions use the `+Nat.toText+` function to convert the `+count+` variable to text.
--
+
Query calls return results faster.
In designing an application, you should consider where a query call might make your program more efficient. 
For more information about the difference between update and query calls, see link:developers-guide/introduction-key-concepts{outfilesuffix}#canister-state[Canisters include both program and state].
+
If you want to copy and paste the whole program at once, it looks like this:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$preview-hello.mo[]
----
. Save your changes and close the modified `+main.mo+` file.

==== Deploy the application

To deploy the application:

. Start the {IC} network locally on your computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
. Register, build, and deploy all of the canisters specified in the default `+dfx.json+` file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy my_counter_hello
----
+
In this case, we specify a canister name to register, build, and deploy because we haven't added any front-end code to the project.

==== Test the application in a terminal

To test the application in a terminal:

. Call the `+whoami+` function with your name as an argument by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter_hello whoami '("YOUR-NAME")'
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
("Welcome to the simplified developer preview, Jane: 1")
----
+
Repeat the call the `+whoami+` function a few times to see the counter value increment.
. Call the `+get+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter_hello get
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
("Your counter value is: 3")
----

==== Test functions in a browser

To test the application in a browser:

. Copy the canister identifier for the `+my_counter_hello+` canister.
. Open a browser and navigate to the default host name and port.
. Add the `+candid+` endpoint followed by `canisterId`+ and the canister identifier for the `+my_counter_hello+` canister.
+
If you are using the default local host and port, you should have a URL similar to the following:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/candid?canisterId=75hes-oqbaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
....
. Type a name for the `whoami` function, then click *Call* to see the result. 
. Delete the text from the `whoami` function, then click *Lucky* to generate a random text value and see the result.
. Click *Query* for the `get` function.

==== Stop the local network

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.
. Stop the local {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----

[[next-steps]]
== Next steps and how you can help

This _{sdk-short-name}_ touched on only a few key steps to introduce the simplified developer workflow.

After you have experimented with the {sdk-short-name} and the tutorial examples in this document, we would love to hear from you.  

Our key questions are:

* How would you rank your experience with the new workflow compared to the current workflow on a scale of one (I don’t see why you would change what you have!) to ten (Please implement this as soon as possible!)’

* Do you have suggestions for improving either this new workflow or the existing workflow?

* What is the single most important thing we should change that would improve the experience of building apps for the Internet Computer?
