Use the `+dfx replica+` command to start a {IC} replica process (without a web server) locally.
This command enables you to deploy canisters locally to simulate network deployment and to test your programs during development.

Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure.
For example, if your project name is `+hello_world+`, your current working directory must be the `+hello_world+` top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories.
