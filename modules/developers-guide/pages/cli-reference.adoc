The DFINITY command-line execution environment (`+dfx+`) is the primary tool for creating, deploying, and managing the applications you develop for the {platform}.

You can use the `+dfx+` parent command with different flags and subcommands to perform different types of operations.

The basic syntax for running `+dfx+` commands is:

[source,bash]
----
dfx [option] [subcommand] [flag]
----

Depending on the subcommand, the options and flags you specify might apply to the parent command or to a specific subcommand.
For example, the flags for enabling or suppressing verbose logging are specified for the `+dfx+` parent command, then applied to any subcommands. 

When you have the {sdk-short-name} installed, you can use the following commands to specify the operation you want to perform.
For reference information and examples that illustrate using these commands, select an appropriate command.
