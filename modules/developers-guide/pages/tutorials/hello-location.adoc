This tutorial provides a simple variation on the default program that lets you pass a single string argument to a single actor (object), compile the code to create a canister, then retrieve the argument.

This tutorial illustrates the options to explicitly specify the argument type and how to have the argument type inferred using the interface description language (IDL).
The tutorial also illustrates how you could modify the program to allow it to accept more than one value for the string argument.

== Before you begin

* You have downloaded and installed the SDK as described in
link:../getting-started{outfilesuffix}[Getting started].
* You have stopped any network client processes running on the local computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello_location
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello_location
----

== Verify the default configuration

You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default `dfx.json` configuration file to your project directory.
Review the default settings in the file to verify the file and directory names reflect the names you want to use.

To verify settings in the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
. Check the default settings for the `+hello_location+` project.
+
[source,json,subs="quotes"]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "*hello_location*": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/*hello_location*/public/index.js"
      },
      "main": "src/*hello_location*/main.mo"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "output": "canisters/"
    },
    "start": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8000,
      "serve_root": "canisters/*hello_location*/assets"
    }
  }
}
----
. Close the file to continue.

== Modify the default template program

You have already seen that creating a new project creates a default `+src+` directory with a template `+main.mo+` file.

To modify the default template source code:

. Open the `+src/hello_location/main.mo+` source code file in a text editor.
. Modify the default source code to replace the `+greet+` function with a `+location+` function and the `+name+` argument with a `+city+` argument.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
actor {
    public func *location(city* : Text) : async Text {
        return "Hello, " # *city* # "!";
    };
};
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Build and deploy the program

You now have a program that you can compile into an executable WebAssembly module that you can deploy—using the canister model—on your local client network.

To build the program executable:

. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
. Deploy your `+hello_location+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install hello_location
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Installing code for canister hello_location, with canister_id ic:E75C3765B661880C3E
----

== Pass a string argument to the canister

You now have a program deployed as a *canister* on your local client network and can test your program by using `+dfx canister call+` commands.

To test the program you have deployed on the local client network:

. Call the `+location+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument of type `+string+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
dfx canister call hello_location location *"San Francisco"* --type string
----
+
In this example, you are explicitly identifying your argument data type as a string.
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*"Hello, San Francisco!"*)
----
. Call the `+location+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument without specifying a type to have the interface description language infer the type automatically by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello_location location '("Paris")'
----
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*"Hello, Paris!"*)
----
. Rerun the `+dfx canister call+` command using San Francisco as the `+city+` argument without specifying a type to have the interface description language infer the type automatically by running the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
dfx canister call hello_location location '("San Francisco")'
----
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*"Hello, San Francisco!"*)
----
+ 
Because your program only accepts a single string argument, specifying multiple strings only returns the first argument.
+
For example, if you run the following command:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
dfx canister call hello_location location '("San Francisco","Paris","Rome")'
----
+
Only the first argument is returned:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*"Hello, San Francisco!"*)
----

== Revise the source code in your program

To extend what you have learned in this tutorial, you might want to try modifying the source code to return different results.
For example, you might want to modify the `+location+` function to return multiple city names.

To experiment with modifying the source code for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor and change the default `+hello_location+` settings to `+favorite-cities+`.
For example:
+
[source,json,subs="quotes"]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "*favorite-cities*": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/*favorite-cities*/public/index.js"
      },
      "main": "src/*favorite-cities*/main.mo"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "output": "canisters/"
    },
    "start": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8000,
      "serve_root": "canisters/*favorite-cities*/assets"
    }
----
. Copy the `hello_location` source file directory to match the name specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file by running the following command
+
[source,bash]
----
cp -r src/hello_location src/favorite-cities
----
. Open the `+src/favorite-cities/main.mo+` file in a text editor.
. Copy and paste the following code sample to replace the `+location+` function with two new functions.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
actor {
    public func location(cities : [Text]) : async Text {
        return "Hello, from " # (debug_show cities) # "!";
    };
    public func location_pretty(cities : [Text]) : async Text {
        var str = "Hello from ";
        for (city in cities.vals()) {
                str := str # city #", ";
        };
        return str # "bon voyage!";
    }
};
----
+
You might notice that `+Text+` in this code example is enclosed by square (`+[ ]+`) brackets. By itself, `+Text+` represents a collection of UTF-8 characters. 
The square brackets around a type indicate that it is an *array* of that type.
In this context, therefore, the `+[Text]+` indicates an array of a collection of UTF-8 characters, enabling the program to accept and return multiple text strings.
+
The code sample also uses the basic format of an `+apply+` operation for the array, which can be abstracted as:
+
[source,bash]
----
public func apply<A, B>(fs : [A -> B], xs : [A]) : [B] {
    var ys : [B] = [];
    for (f in fs.vals()) {
      ys := append<B>(ys, map<A, B>(f, xs));
    };
    ys;
};
----
+
For information about the functions that perform operations on arrays, see the description of the standard library `+array.mo+` in the _{proglang} Programming Language Reference_.
. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build --skip-frontend
----
+
For this tutorial, you can build using the `--skip-frontend` because you aren't changing the default front-end for the new program.
If you also wanted to update the front-end, you would open the default `+src/favorite-cities/public/index.js+` file to change the canister name and make other changes. 
. Deploy your `+favorite-cities+` program on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install favorite-cities
----
. Call the `+location+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument using the interface description syntax by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call favorite-cities location '(vec {"San Francisco";"Paris";"Rome"})'
----
+
The command uses the interface description syntax `+(vec { val1; val2; val3; })+` to return vector of values.
For more information about the interface description syntax, see link:../cli-reference{outfilesuffix}#idl-syntax[Interface description syntax for arguments].
+
This command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
("Hello, from [\"San Francisco\", \"Paris\", \"Rome\"]!")
----
. Call the `+location_pretty+` method in the program and pass your `+city+` argument using the interface description syntax by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call favorite-cities location_pretty '(vec {"San Francisco";"Paris";"Rome"})'
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
("Hello from San Francisco, Paris, Rome, bon voyage!")

== Stop the local network

. Stop the {IC} processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
