[[net-quick-start]]
This _Quick Start_ scenario assumes that you are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time and deploying the default project on the {IC} network **running remotely**.

If you are only deploying projects in a local development environment, see the link:local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Local development] scenario.

To get started, let's build and deploy a simple Hello application that has just one function—called `+greet+`. 
The `+greet+` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello,{nbsp}everyone!** in a terminal if you run the application using the command-line or in an HTML page if you access the application in a browser.

[[net-before]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install this release of the {sdk-short-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local **macOS** or **Linux** computer.
+
Currently, the {sdk-short-name} only runs on computers with a macOS or Linux operating system.

//* You have provided the {company-id} Foundation with a principal associated with your user identity and have received a **wallet canister identifier** in return.
//+
//A wallet canister with **cycles** is required to deploy and manage applications on the {IC}.
//
* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to access the default front-end for the default project.

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer or how to install `node.js`, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers].
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Download and install>>.

[[net-download-sdk]]
== Download and install

You can download the latest version of the {sdk-long-name} directly from within a terminal shell on your local computer.

To download and install:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download and install the {sdk-short-name} package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) and its dependencies on your local computer.
. Type `+y+` and press kbd:[Return] to continue with the installation.
+
The command displays information about the components being installed on the local computer.

[[net-verify-sdk-version]]
== Verify the SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the {platform} will be available on your local computer.

To verify the SDK is ready to use:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Check that you have the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) installed and the `+dfx+` executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the `+dfx+` command-line executable similar to the following:
+
....
dfx 0.7.0
....
. Preview usage information for the other `+dfx+` command-line sub-commands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----
+
The command displays usage information for the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

[[net-new-project]]
== Create a new project

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You create projects using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.
Creating a new project with `+dfx+` adds a default project directory structure to your development workspace with template files to get you started.

To create a new project for your first application:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----
+
The `+dfx new hello+` command creates a new `+hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+hello+` Git repository for your project.
+
If you use a different project name instead of `+hello+`, make note of the name you used. You'll need to use that project name in place of the `+hello+` project name throughout these instructions.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

[[ping-the-network]]
== Check the connection to the network

Before you can deploy your first project on the {IC} network, you need to connect to the network gateway running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.
A network alias for the {IC} network gateway is configured in your project `+dfx.json+` file by default.

To check your connection to the {IC} network:

[arabic]
. Check that you are in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Check the current status of the {IC} network and your ability to connect to it by running the following command for the network alias `+ic+`:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx ping ic
----
+
If you modify the network alias for the {IC} network in your `+dfx.json+` file, replace the `+ic+` network alias with the alias you are using in this and subsequent commands.
. Verify the command returns information about the {IC} network to which you are connecting.
+
For example, you should see output similar to the following:
+
....
{
  "ic_api_version": "0.14.0"  "impl_hash": "40d5e890ae5c3558fbb4281ec04a5c0d0c1c0104012a33dfc8ecb0445057f405"  "impl_version": "0.1.0"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 133, 168, 228, 168, 232, 127, 43, 51, 212, 173, 127, 167, 169, 84, 223, 125, 69, 157, 31, 105, 91, 34, 207, 123, 136, 227, 152, 187, 36, 246, 25, 58, 90, 24, 169, 86, 122, 201, 212, 11, 111, 43, 156, 193, 106, 11, 210, 217, 22, 13, 187, 148, 153, 152, 176, 171, 45, 130, 247, 231, 157, 251, 92, 190, 202, 13, 150, 116, 95, 187, 28, 157, 173, 170, 60, 156, 45, 127, 248, 25, 95, 9, 43, 102, 161, 46, 198, 237, 227, 77, 244, 79, 227, 134, 69, 161]
}
....

[[net-deploy]]
== Register, build, and deploy the application

After you connect to the {IC} network, you can register, build, and deploy your application.

To deploy your first application on the {IC}:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Ensure that `+node+` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----
+
For more information about this step, see link:../developers-guide/webpack-config{outfilesuffix}#troubleshoot-node[Ensuring node is available in a project].
. Register, build, and deploy your first application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network=ic
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
+
For example, this step registers two network-specific identifiers—one for the `+hello+` main program and one for the `+hello_assets+` front-end user interface—and installation information similar to the following:
+
....
Creating a wallet canister on the ic network.

....
. Call the `+hello+` canister and the predefined `+greet+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=ic call hello greet everyone
----
+
Let's take a closer look at this example:
+
-- 

* Using the `+--network=ic+` option indicates that the canister you want to call is deployed on the `+ic+` network. The `+ic+` network alias is an internally-reserved alias for accessing the {IC}.
* Note that the `+--network=ic+` option must precede the operation subcommand, which, in this case, is the `+dfx canister call+` command.
* The `+hello+` argument specifies the name of the canister you want to call.
* The `+greet+` argument specifies the name of the function you want to call in the `+hello+` canister.
* The text string `+everyone+` is the argument that you want to pass to the `+greet+` function.
--
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....
+
You might have noticed that deploying your project automatically generated a wallet for your `+default+` identity.
This wallet canister is preconfigured with cycles and provides a few basic functions that enable you to experiment with sending and receiving cycles without requiring an account with ICP tokens.
+
If you didn't notice the wallet canister identifier when you ran `+dfx deploy+`, you can look it up now by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity --network=ic get-wallet
----
. Check the cycle balance for your default wallet canister by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=ic call <WALLET-CANISTER-ID> wallet_balance
----
+
This command returns the balance for the wallet canister identifier you specified using the Candid syntax for `+record+` data types. 
For example, the command might display a record with an `+amount+` field (represented by the hash `+3_573_748_184+`) and a
balance of 99,999.974,174,602 cycles like this:
+
....
(record { 3_573_748_184 = 99_999_974_174_602 })
....
. Call the `+greet+` function again with a different argument.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=ic call hello greet '("San Francisco")'
----
. Rerun the command to check the cycle balance for your wallet.
+
For example, you might run a command similar to the following if the wallet canister identifier is `+oi7fh-tiaaa-aaaab-aahpq-cai+`:
+
....
dfx canister --network=ic call oi7fh-tiaaa-aaaab-aahpq-cai wallet_balance
....
+
Note that in the new balance, a small number of cycles have been deducted from the previous total of cycles available.
For example:
+
....
(record { 3_573_748_184 = 99_999_974_082_913 })
....
+
In this example, the new balance is 99,999,974,082,913 cycles.

[[quickstart-frontend]]
== Test the application front-end

Now that you have verified that your application has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let's verify that you can access the front-end using your web browser.

To access the application front-end:

. Open a browser.
. Navigate to the front-end for the application using a URL that consists of the `+hello_assets+` identifier and the `+.ic0.app+` suffix.
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
....
https://pnbda-pyaaa-aaaab-qanva-cai.ic0.app/
....
+
Navigating to this URL displays the HTML entry page for the template application with a sample asset image file, an input field, and a button.
For example:
+
image:net-front-end-prompt.png[Sample HTML page]

. Type a greeting, then click *Click Me* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:net-result.png[Hello, Everyone! greeting]
