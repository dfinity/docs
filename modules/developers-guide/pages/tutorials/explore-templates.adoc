If you started your tour of the {sdk-long-name} with the link:../../quickstart/quickstart-intro{outfilesuffix}[Quick start], you have already seen the basic work flow for creating applications that run on the {IC}.
Now, let's take a closer look at that work flow by exploring the default files and folders that are added to your workspace when you create a new project.

As a preview, the following diagram illustrates the development work flow when running the {IC} locally on you computer.

== Before you begin

Before you start this tutorial, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.

* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for {proglang} as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#install-vscode[Install the language editor plug-in] if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE.

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project

As discussed in the link:../../quickstart/quickstart-intro{outfilesuffix}[Quick start], applications for the {IC} start as **projects** that you create. You can create projects using the `+dfx+` executable command-line interface (CLI).

To take a closer look at the files and folders that are included in a  project by default, let's create a new project to work with.

To create a new project:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a folder for your {IC} sample projects in your home directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/ic-projects
----
. Change to your sample projects folder.
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects
----
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new explore_hello
----
+
The `+dfx new explore_hello+` command creates a new `+explore_hello+`
project, including a default project directory structure under the new
project name and a new Git repository for your project.
If you have `+node.js+` installed locally, creating a new project also adds some template front-end code and dependencies.
+
To ensure that project names are valid when used in JavaScript, Motoko, and other contexts, you should only use alphanumeric characters and underscores.
You cannot include dashes or any special characters.
+
The command displays output similar to the following excerpt:
+
....
Fetching manifest https://sdk.dfinity.org/manifest.json
Creating new project "explore_hello"...
CREATE       explore_hello/src/explore_hello/main.mo (107B)...
CREATE       explore_hello/dfx.json (320B)...
CREATE       explore_hello/.gitignore (189B)...
CREATE       explore_hello/README.md (1.01KB)...
CREATE       explore_hello/src/explore_hello/public/index.js (155B)...
CREATE       explore_hello/package.json (263B)...
CREATE       explore_hello/webpack.config.js (1.76KB)...
....
. View the default directory structure by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l explore_hello
----
+
By default, the project directory structure includes at least one source subdirectory, a template `+README.md+` file, and a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
Depending on whether you have `+node.js+` installed, your project directory might include some or all of the following files:
+
....
explore_hello/
├── README.md      # default project documentation
├── dfx.json       # project configuration file
├── node_modules   # libraries for front-end development
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src            # source files directory
|   └── explore_hello
│       ├── main.mo
│       └── public
│           └── index.js
└── webpack.config.js
....
+
At a minimum, the default project directory includes the following folders and files:
+
--
* A default `README` file for documenting your project in the repository.
* A default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to set configurable options for your project.
* A default `+src+` directory for all of the source files required by your application.
--
+
The default `+src+` directory includes a template `+main.mo+` file that you can modify or replace to include your core programming logic.
+
Because this tutorial focuses on the basics of getting started, you are only going to use the `+main.mo+` file.
If you have `+node.js+` installed, your project directory includes additional files and directories that you can use to define the front-end interface for your application.
Front-end development and the template files in the `+public+` folder are discussed a little later.

== Review the default configuration

By default, creating a new project adds some template files to your project directory.
You can edit these template files to customize the configuration settings for your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To review the default configuration file for your project:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd explore_hello
----
. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor to review the default settings.
+
For example:
+
....
include::example$sample-explore-dfx.json[]
....
+
Let's take a look at a few of the default settings.
+
--
* The `+canisters+` section specifies the name of the WebAssembly module for your `+explore_hello+` project is `+explore_hello+`.
* The `+canisters.explore_hello+` key specifies that the main program to be compiled is located in the path specified by the `+main+` setting, in this case, `+src/explore_hello/main.mo+` and the `+type+` setting indicates that this is a `+motoko+` program.
* The `+canisters.explore_hello_assets+` key specifies configuration details about front-end assets for this project. Let's skip those for now.
* The `+dfx+` setting is used to identify the version of the software used to create the project.
* The `+networks+` section specifies information about the networks to which you connect. The default settings bind the local {IC} network to the local host address `+127.0.0.1+` and port `+8000+`.
+
If you have access to other {IC} network providers, the `+networks+` section can include network aliases and URLs for connecting to those providers.
--
+
You can leave the default settings as they are.
. Close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.

== Review the default program code

New projects always include a template `main.mo` source code file.
You can edit this file to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

Let's take a look at the sample program in the default `main.mo` template file as a starting point for creating simple program using the {proglang} programming language.

To review the default sample program for your project:

. Check that you are still in your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
pwd
----
. Open the `+src/explore_hello/main.mo+` file in a text editor and review the code in the template:
+
....
actor {
    public func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
        return "Hello, " # name # "!";
    };
};
....
+
Let's take a look at a few key elements of this program:
+
--
* You might notice that this sample code defines an `+actor+` instead of a `+main+` function, which some programming languages require.
For {proglang}, the `+main+` function is implicit in the file itself.

* Although the traditional "Hello, World!" program illustrates how you can print a string using a `+print+` or `+println+` function, that traditional program would not represent a typical use case for {proglang} programs that run on the {IC}.

* Instead of a print function, this sample program defines an `+actor+` with a public `+greet+` function that takes a `+name+` argument with a type of `+Text+`.

* The program then uses the `+async+` keyword to indicate that the program returns an asynchronous message consisting of a concatenated text string constructed using `+"Hello, "+`, the `+#+` operator, the `+name+` argument, and `+"!"+`.
--
We’ll explore code that uses `+actor+` objects and asynchronous message handling more a little later.
For now, you can continue to the next section.
. Close the `+main.mo+` file to continue.

[[start-the-local-network]]
== Start the local network

Before you can build the default project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running *locally* in your development environment or running *remotely* on a sub-network that you can access.

As a best practice, this step requires you to have two terminal shells open, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/explore_hello+` in the new terminal if your `+explore_hello+` project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have **two terminals** open with your **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed.
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
+
After you start the local network, you have one terminal that displays messages about network operations and another for performing project-related tasks.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to the terminal where you created your new project.

== Register canister identifiers

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register with the network to generate unique, network-specific *canister identifiers* for your project.

In the link:../../quickstart/quickstart-intro{outfilesuffix}[Quick start] tutorial, this step was performed as part of the `+dfx deploy+` command work flow.
This tutorial demonstrates how to perform each of the operations independently.

To register canister identifiers for the local network:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Register unique canister identifiers for the canisters in the project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----
+
The command displays the network-specific canister identifiers for the canisters defined in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
....
Creating canister "explore_hello"...
"explore_hello" canister created with canister id: "rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai"
Creating canister "explore_hello_assets"...
"explore_hello_assets" canister created with canister id: "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"
....
+
Because you are connected to the {IC} network running locally, these canister identifiers are only valid locally and are stored for the project in the `+.dfx/local/canister_ids.json+` file.
+
For example:
+
....
{
  "explore_hello": {
    "local": "rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai"
  },
  "explore_hello_assets": {
    "local": "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"
  }
}
....


== Build the program

Now that you have explored the default configuration settings and program code and have started the {IC} network, let's compile the default program into an executable WebAssembly module.

To build the program executable:

[arabic]
. In the terminal shell on your local computer, navigate to your `+explore_hello+` project directory.
+
You must run the `+dfx build+` command from within the project directory structure.
. Build the executable canister by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
....
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
....
+
Because you are connected to the {IC} network running locally, the `+dfx build+` command adds the `+canisters+` directory under the `+.dfx/local/+` directory for the project.
. Verify that the `+.dfx/local/canisters/explore_hello+` directory created by the `+dfx build+` command contains the WebAssembly and related application files by running the following command.
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l .dfx/local/canisters/explore_hello/
----
+
For example, the command returns output similar to the following:
+
....
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff     43 Jul 21 12:18 explore_hello.did
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff    103 Jul 21 12:18 explore_hello.did.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff    174 Jul 21 12:18 explore_hello.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff  95905 Jul 21 12:18 explore_hello.wasm
....
+
The `canisters/explore_hello` directory contains the following key files:
+
--
* The `+explore_hello.did+` file contains an interface description for your main program.

* The `+explore_hello.did.js+` file contains a JavaScript representation of the canister interface for the functions in your program.

* The `+explore_hello.js+` file contains a JavaScript representation of the canister interface for your program.

* The `+explore_hello.wasm+` file contains the compiled WebAssembly for the assets used in your project.

--
+
The `+canisters/explore_hello_assets+` directory contains similar files to describe the front-end assets associated with your project.
+
In addition to the files in the `+canisters/explore_hello+` and the `+canisters/explore_hello_assets+` directories, the `+dfx build+` command creates an `+idl+` directory.

== Deploy the project locally

You've seen that the `+dfx build+` command creates several artifacts in a `canisters` directory for your project.
The WebAssembly modules and the `+canister_manifest.json+` file are required for your program to be deployed on the {IC} network.

To deploy locally:

[arabic]
. In a terminal shell on your local computer, navigate to your `+explore_hello+` project directory.
. Deploy your `+explore_hello+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
Installing code for canister explore_hello, with canister_id rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai
Installing code for canister explore_hello_assets, with canister_id rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
....
. Call the predefined `+greet+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call explore_hello greet everyone
----
+
This example uses the `+dfx canister call+` command to pass "everyone" as an argument to the `+greet+` function.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....

[[default-frontend]]
== View the default front-end

If you have `+node.js+` installed in your development environment, your project includes a simple front-end example that uses a template `+index.js+` JavaScript file for accessing the `+explore_hello+` program in a browser.

To explore the default front-end template:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open, and navigate to your `+explore_hello+` project directory.
. Open the `+src/explore_hello_assets/public/index.js+` file in a text editor and review the code in the template script:
+
....
import explore_hello from 'ic:canisters/explore_hello';

explore_hello.greet(window.prompt("Enter your name:")).then(greeting => {
  window.alert(greeting);
});
....
+
The template `+index.js+` file uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to describe the structure and content of a document on the web.
+
This sample file imports the canister you created and calls the `+greet+` function in a prompt window.
. Close the `+index.js+` file to continue.
. View the front-end assets created for the project by running following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l .dfx/local/canisters/explore_hello_assets/
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
total 464
drwxr-xr-x  5 pubs  staff     160 Jan 21 14:30 assets
-r--r--r--  1 pubs  staff     217 Dec 31  1969 assetstorage.did
-r--r--r--  1 pubs  staff  110059 Dec 31  1969 assetstorage.wasm
-rw-rw-rw-  1 pubs  staff     217 Dec 31  1969 explore_hello_assets.did

-rw-rw-rw-  1 pubs  staff  110059 Dec 31  1969 explore_hello_assets.wasm
....
+
These files were generated automatically by the `+dfx build+` command using node modules and the template `+index.js+` file.
. Open a browser and navigate to the `+local+` network address and port number—`+127.0.0.1:8000/+`—specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
To specify the canister you want the web server to display, add the `+canisterId+` parameter and the  `+explore_hello_assets+` canister identifier to the URL using the following syntax:
+
....
?canisterId=<YOUR-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER>
....
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai
....
+
NOTE: You must use the case-sensitive `+canisterId+` parameter before the canister identifier.

. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:prompt-window.png[Hello world prompt window]
. Type a greeting, then click *OK* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:alert-window.png[Hello world return string]
. Click *OK* to close the pop-up alert window.

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
