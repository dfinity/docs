Now that you have a basic understanding of how to create, build, and deploy a simple dapp and are familiar with the default project files and sample front-end, you might want to start experimenting with different ways to customize the front-end user experience for your project.

This tutorial illustrates using the React framework to create a new front-end for the default sample dapp and guides you through some basic modifications to customize the interface displayed.
Later tutorials expand on the techniques introduced here, but if you already know how to use CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React or other frameworks to build your user interface, you can skip this tutorial.

NOTE: This tutorial illustrates using the React framework to manage the Document Object Model (DOM) for your canister smart contract.
Because React has its own custom DOM syntax, you need to modify the webpack configuration to compile the front-end code, which is written in JSX. For more information about learning to use React and JSX, see link:https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html[Getting started] on the https://reactjs.org/[React website].

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have `+node.js+` installed for front-end development and can install packages using `+npm install+` in your project.
For information about installing node for your local operating system and package manager, see the link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node] website.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for {proglang} as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#install-vscode[Install the language editor plug-in] if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE.

* You have stopped any {sdk-short-name} processes running on the local
computer.

NOTE: This tutorial requires you to use the {sdk-short-name} version `+0.8.0+` or later.

This tutorial takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project directory for your custom front-end dapp:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} projects, if you are using one.
. Check that you have `+node.js+` installed locally by running the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
which node
which npm
----
+
If you don't have `+node.js+` installed, you should download and install it before continuing to the next step.
For information about installing node for your local operating system and package manager, see the link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node] website.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new custom_greeting
----
+
The `+dfx new custom_greeting+` command creates a new `+custom_greeting+` project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd custom_greeting
----

== Install the React framework

If you've never used React before, you might want to explore the link:https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html[Intro to React] tutorial or the link:https://reactjs.org/[React website] before editing the front-end code.

To install required framework modules:

. Install the React module by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save react react-dom
----
. Install the required TypeScript language compiler loader by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader
----
+
NOTE: As an alternative to installing these modules, you can edit the default `+package.json+` file to add dependencies for your project.
+
....
include::example$custom-frontend-package.json[]
....

== Review the default configuration

Before we make any changes to use React for this tutorial, let's review the default front-end settings in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file for your project.

To review the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
. Notice that the `+canisters+` key includes settings for a `custom_greeting_assets` canister.
+
....
{
  "canisters": {
    ...

    "custom_greeting_assets": {
      "dependencies": [
        "custom_greeting"
      ],
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.html"
      },
      "source": [
        "src/custom_greeting_assets/assets",
        "dist/custom_greeting_assets/"
      ],
      "type": "assets"
    }
  }
}
....
+
Let's take a look at the settings in this section.
+
--
* Front-end assets for your project are compiled into their own canister, in this case, a canister named `+custom_greeting_assets+`.

* The assets canister has a default dependency on the main canister for the project.

* The `+frontend.entrypoint+` setting specifies the path to a file—in this case, the `+index.html+` file—to use as your dapp entry point.
If you had a different starting point—for example, a custom `first-page.html` file—you would modify this setting.

* The `+source+` settings specify the path to your `src` and `dist` directories. The `src` setting specifies the directory to use for static assets that will be included in your assets canister when you build your project.
If you have custom cascading stylesheet (CSS) or JavaScript files, you would include them in the folder specified by this path.
After building the project, the project assets are served from the directory specified by the `+dist+` setting.

* The `+type+` setting specifies that the `+custom_greeting_assets+` should use the https://github.com/dfinity/certified-assets[certified asset canister], which comes with everything you need to host static assets on the {platform}.
--
+
For this tutorial, we are going to add React JavaScript in an `+index.jsx+` file, but that won't require any changes to the default settings in the `dfx.json` file.
. Close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.

== Review the default front-end files

For this tutorial, you are going to make calls to the default `+main.mo+` canister through a custom front-end.
Before you make any changes, though, let's take a look at what's in the default front-end files for a project.

To review the default front-end files:

. Open the `+src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.html+` file in a text editor.
+
This template file is the default front-end entry point for the dapp as specified by the `+frontend.entrypoint+` setting in the `dfx.json` file.
+
This file contains standard HTML with references to a CSS file and an image that are located in the `+src/custom_greeting_assets/assets+` directory. 
The default `+index.html+` file also includes standard HTML syntax for displaying an input field for the `+name+` argument and a clickable button.
+
This is the same default front-end you saw in link:explore-templates{outfilesuffix}#default-frontend[Viewing the default front-end].
. Open the `+src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.js+` file in a text editor.
+
....
import { custom_greeting } from "../../declarations/custom_greeting";

document.getElementById("clickMeBtn").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const name = document.getElementById("name").value.toString();
  // Interact with custom_greeting actor, calling the greet method
  const greeting = await custom_greeting.greet(name);

  document.getElementById("greeting").innerText = greeting;
});
....
+
--
* The `import` statement points to an actor that will allow us to make calls to our `custom_greeting` canister from `"../declarations"`
* The declarations haven't been created yet, but we will come back to that.
--
. Close the `+index.js+` file to continue.

== Modify the front-end files

You are now ready to create a new front-end for the default dapp.

To prepare the front-end files:

. Open the webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) in a text editor.
. Modify the front-end entry to replace the default `+index.html+` with `+index.jsx+`.
+
[source,js]
----
entry: {
  // The frontend.entrypoint points to the HTML file for this build, so we need
  // to replace the extension to `.js`.
  index: path.join(__dirname, asset_entry).replace(/\.html$/, ".jsx"),
},
----
. Add the following `+module+` key above the `+plugins+` section:
+
[source,json]
----
module: {
  rules: [
    { test: /\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: "ts-loader" }
  ]
},
----
+
This setting enables the project to use the `+ts-loader+` compiler for a React JavaScript `+index.jsx+` file.
Note that there's a commented section in the default `webpack.config.js` file that you can modify to add the `module` key.
. Create a new file named `+tsconfig.json+` in the root directory for your project.
. Open the `+tsconfig.json+` file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following into the file:
+
[source,json]
----
include::example$sample-tsconfig.json[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+tsconfig.json+` file to continue.
. Open the default `+src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.js+` file in a text editor and delete lines 2 to 9.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+index.js+` file:
+
[source,react]
----
include::example$react-index.jsx[]
----
. Rename the modified `index.js` file as `index.jsx` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.js src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.jsx
----
. Open the default `+src/custom_greeting_assets/src/index.html+` file in a text editor, then replace the body contents with `+<div id="app"></div>+`.
+
For example:
+
[source,html]
----
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>custom_greeting</title>
    <base href="/">
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" />
 </head>
 <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
 </body>
</html>
----

== Start the local canister execution environment

Before you can build the `+custom_greeting+` project, you need to connect to either the live {platform}, or a canister execution environment running locally in your development environment.

To start the environment locally:

. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer.
. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary.
. Start the local canister execution environment on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
+
After the local canister execution environment completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step.

== Register, build, and deploy the dapp

After you connect to the local canister execution environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp locally.

To deploy the dapp locally:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Register, build, and deploy your dapp by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.

== View the new front-end

You can now access the new front-end for the default dapp by entering the canister identifier for the assets canister in a browser.

To view the custom front-end:

. Open a new tab or window of your terminal and run
+
[source,bash]
----
npm start
----
. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:react-greeting.png[Sample front-end]
. Replace *Name* in the input field with the text you want to display, then click *Get Greeting* to see the result.
+
For example:
+
image:greeting-response.png[Greeting result]

== Revise the front-end and test your changes

After viewing the front-end, you might want to make some changes.

To modify the front-end:

. Open the `index.jsx` file in a text editor and modify its style settings.
For example, you might want to change the font family and use a placeholder for the input field by making changes similar to the following:
+
[source,react]
....
include::example$react-revised-index.jsx[]
....
. Save the file and view the updated page in your browser.
+
For example:
+
image:revised-greeting.png[Modified styles on your entry page]
. Type a new message and see your new greeting.
For example:
+
image:modified-result.png[Modified greeting result]

== Stop the local canister execution environment

After you finish experimenting with the front-end for your dapp, you can stop the local canister execution environment so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays the webpack development server, press Control-C to interrupt the dev-server.

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the local canister execution environment by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
