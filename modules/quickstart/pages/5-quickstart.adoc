== 5. Deploying On-chain (1 min)

== 5.1 Deploy the dapp on-chain via dfx (Terminal B)

Now that you have your cycles and your dfx is configured to transfer cycles, you are now ready to deploy your `Hello` dapp on-chain.

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install
----

[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network ic --with-cycles 1000000000000
----

The `--network` option specifies the network alias or URL for deploying the dapp. This option is required to install on the Internet Computer blockchain mainnet. `--wth-cycles` explicitly tells `dfx` how many cycles to use, otherwise it will use the default of 3 trillion.

If successful, your terminal should look like this: 

[source,bash]

URLs:
  Frontend:

  Candid:

----

Note the bottom of the message which returns the URL where you can see your canister's frontend deployed on-chain: https://5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.ic0.app/

In the example above, we created a `Hello` dapp that is composed of two canisters: 

a. `hello` canister `5o6tz-saaaa-aaaaa-qaacq-cai` which contains the backend logic.

b. `hello_assets` canister `5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai` which contains the frontend assets (e.g. HTML, JS, CSS).

== 5.2 See your dapp live on-chain via a browser

Navigate to and enter a name: https://5h5yf-eiaaa-aaaaa-qaada-cai.ic0.app/

== 5.3 Testing the on-chain dapp via command line (Terminal B)

Since the canister has a method called `greet` (which accepts a string as a parameter), we can send it a message via `dfx`.

[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network ic call hello greet '("everyone": text)'
----

Note the way the message is constructed:

* `dfx canister --network ic call` is setup for calling a canister on the IC

* `hello greet` means we are sending a message to a canister named `hello` and evoking its `greet` method

* `'("everyone": text)'` is the parameter we are sending to `greet` (which accepts `Text` as its only input).

== Conclusion

You have now deployed the dapp on-chain! You can read the conclusion of the tutorial.

== Troubleshooting

=== 403 Error

If you receive a 403 error, it is possible the identity you are using does not have enough cycles. You should try the following to debug:

== 1. Confirm you are using the identity you assume are using

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity whoami
----

== 2. Confirm the identity you are using has enough cycles on-chain

[source,bash]
----
dfx wallet --network ic balance
----
