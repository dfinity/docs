Use the `+dfx identity+` command with subcommands and flags to manage the identities used to execute commands and communicate with the Internet Computer network. 
Creating multiple user identities enables you to test user-based access controls.

The basic syntax for running `+dfx identity+` commands is:

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity [subcommand] [flag]
----

Depending on the `+dfx identity+` subcommand you specify, additional arguments, options, and flags might apply or be required.
To view usage information for a specific `+dfx identity+` subcommand, specify the subcommand and the `+--help+` flag.
For example, to see usage information for `+dfx identity new+`, you can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity new --help
----

For reference information and examples that illustrate using `+dfx identity+` commands, select an appropriate command.

== Creating a default identity

The first time you run the `+dfx canister create+` command to register an identifier, your public/private key pair credentials are used to create a `+default+` user identity.
The credentials for the `+default+` user are migrated from `+$HOME/.dfinity/identity/creds.pem+` to `+$HOME/.config/dfx/identity/default/identity.pem+`.

You can then use `+dfx identity new+` to create new user identities and store credentials for those identities in `+$HOME/.config/dfx/identity/<identity_name>/identity.pem+` files.
For example, you can create an identity named `+ic_admin+` by running the following command:

....
dfx identity new ic_admin
....

This command adds a private key for the `+ic_admin+` user identity in the `+~/.config/dfx/identity/ic_admin/identity.pem+` file.

== dfx identity get-principal

Use the `+dfx identity get-principal+` command to display the textual representation of a principal associated with the current user identity context.

If you haven't created any user identities, you can use this command to display the principal for the `+default+` user.
The textual representation of a principal can be useful for establishing and testing role-based authorization scenarios.

=== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity get-principal [flag]
----

=== Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `+dfx identity get-principal+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Description
|`+-h+`, `+--help+` |Displays usage information.
|`+-V+`, `+--version+` |Displays version information.
|===

=== Example

If you want to display the textual representation of a principal associated with a specific user identity context, you can run commands similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity use ic_admin
dfx identity get-principal
----

In this example, the first command sets the user context to use the `+ic_admin+` identity. The second command then returns the principal associated with the `+ic_admin+` identity.

== dfx identity list

Use the `+dfx identity list+` command to display the list of user identities available.
When you run this command, the list displays an asterisk (*) to indicate the currently active user context.
You should note that identities are global. They are not confined to a specific project context.
Therefore, you can use any identity listed by the `+dfx identity list+` command in any project.

=== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity list [flag]
----

=== Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `+dfx identity list+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Description
|`+-h+`, `+--help+` |Displays usage information.
|`+-V+`, `+--version+` |Displays version information.
|===

=== Examples

You can use the `+dfx identity list+` command to list all of the identities you have currently available and to determine which identity is being used as the currently-active user context for running `+dfx+` commands.
For example, you can run the following command to list the identities available:

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity list
----

This command displays the list of identities found similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
alice_auth
bob_standard *
default
ic_admin
----

In this example, the `+bob_standard+` identity is the currently-active user context.
After you run this command to determine the active user, you know that any additional `+dfx+` commands you run are executed using the principal associated with the `+bob_standard+` identity.

== dfx identity new

Use the `+dfx identity new+` command to add new user identities.
You should note that the identities you add are global. They are not confined to a specific project context.
Therefore, you can use any identity you add using the `+dfx identity new+` command in any project.

=== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity new [flag] _identity-name_
----

=== Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `+dfx identity new+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Description
|`+-h+`, `+--help+` |Displays usage information.
|`+-V+`, `+--version+` |Displays version information.
|===

=== Arguments

You must specify the following argument for the `+dfx identity new+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Argument |Description

|`+<identity_name>+` |Specifies the name of the identity to create.
This argument is required.

|===

=== Examples

You can then use `+dfx identity new+` to create new user identities and store credentials for those identities in `+$HOME/.config/dfx/identity/<identity_name>/identity.pem+` files.
For example, you can create an identity named `+ic_admin+` by running the following command:

....
dfx identity new ic_admin
....

This command adds a private key for the `+ic_admin+` user identity in the `+~/.config/dfx/identity/ic_admin/identity.pem+` file.

After adding the private key for the new identity, the command displays confirmation that the identity has been created:

....
Creating identity: "ic_admin".
Created identity: "ic_admin".
....

== dfx identity remove

Use the `+dfx identity remove+` command to remove an existing user identity.
You should note that the identities you add are global. They are not confined to a specific project context.
Therefore, any identity you remove using the `+dfx identity remove+` command will no longer be available in any project.

=== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity remove [flag] _identity-name_
----

=== Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `+dfx identity remove+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Description
|`+-h+`, `+--help+` |Displays usage information.
|`+-V+`, `+--version+` |Displays version information.
|===

=== Arguments

You must specify the following argument for the `+dfx identity remove+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Argument |Description

|`+<identity_name>+` |Specifies the name of the identity to remove.
This argument is required.

|===

=== Examples

You can use the `+dfx identity remove+` command to remove any previously-created identity, including the `+default+` user identity.
For example, if you have added named user identities and want to remove the `+default+` user identity, you can run the following command:

....
dfx identity remove default
....

The command displays confirmation that the identity has been removed:

....
Removing identity "default".
Removed identity "default".
....

Although you can delete the `+default+` identity if you have created other identities to replace it, you must always have at least one identity available.
If you attempt to remove the last remaining user context, the `+dfx identity remove+` command displays an error similar to the following:

....
Identity error:
  Cannot delete the default identity
....

== dfx identity rename

Use the `+dfx identity rename+` command to rename an existing user identity.
You should note that the identities you add are global. They are not confined to a specific project context.
Therefore, any identity you rename using the `+dfx identity rename+` command is available using the new name in any project.

=== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx identity rename [flag] _from_identity-name_ _to_identity-name_
----

=== Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `+dfx identity rename+` command.

For example, if you want to rename a `+test_admin+` identity that you previously created, you would specify the current identity name you want to change **from** and the new name you want to change **to** by running a command similar to the following:

....
dfx identity rename test_admin devops
....

== dfx identity use

Use the `+dfx identity use+` command to specify the user identity you want to active.
You should note that the identities you have available to use are global. They are not confined to a specific project context.
