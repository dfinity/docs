:release: 0.6.20
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix:.adoc]

The {sdk-long-name} enables developers to develop applications for the {IC} using the {proglang} programing language.
{proglang} is a new programming language optimized for creating tamper-proof software and open internet services that will be hosted on the Internet Computer.

The {sdk-short-name} provides everything you need to perform the following key tasks:

- Author canisters in {proglang} and compile them to WebAssembly.
- Run {IC} replica processes locally on your development computer.
- Deploy compiled programs as standalone canisters and interact with the canisters using a command-line interface.

This {release} version of the {sdk-long-name} is an interim update of the {IC} Developer Network available for application testing, demonstration, and exploration.
As part of our commitment to continuous improvement and iterative development focused on addressing developer feedback, this version includes numerous fixes and enhancements.

[IMPORTANT]
=====================================================================
Note that {sdk-long-name} and {proglang} programming language releases are intended to introduce you to building applications that run on the {IC}.
This {release} version of the software and programming language should not be used for developing production applications at this time.
=====================================================================

== Highlights of what's new in {release}

The {release} release primarily both user-facing and internal enhancements, including fixes and updates to {proglang}, the {proglang} base library, and Candid. 

The most significant new features and fixes include the following updates:

* A new notification message that the DFINITY Canister SDK sends anonymous usage data to DFINITY Stiftung by
default has been added to `+dfx+` commands.
The notification message is only displayed once, the first time you run any `+dfx+` subcommand.
For example, the first time you run `+dfx new+` to create a new project, the notification is displayed before any other project creation messages.
+
The purpose of this notification is to inform you that `+dfx+` is configured to collect anonymous information about `+dfx+` command activity and errors.
Collecting anonymous data is enabled by default in an effort to improve the developer experience based on usage patterns and behavior.
+
If you want to prevent the collection of data about `+dfx+` usage, you can explicitly opt-out by setting the following environment
variable:
+
....
DFX_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
....
+
To find out more about the data collected and what your consent means, see the DFINITY Canister SDK link:https://sdk.dfinity.org/sdk-license-agreement.txt[Terms and Conditions].

* The `+dfx+` commands that support the `+--network+` option have been updated to support URLs when specifying the network value.
+
Previously, the `+--network+` option required you to specify a network name that matched a network aliases configured in the project's `+dfx.json+` file.

=== Candid

The Candid web interface has been updated to provide easier navigation and a better user experience.
The updates to the Candid web interface include the following new features and improvements:

* A new Console drawer provides quick access to method output and a list of all available methods as links for fast navigation.
* Canister methods and their related form elements are more clearly separated and annotated.
* Method output is selectable and easier to toggle between text, UI, and JSON formats.
* The layout is now responsive to provide an optimized display when viewing service using mobile devices or other media. 

=== Motoko

* The {proglang} base documentation examples are now executable in the browser.

* The {proglang} compiler supports specifying command-line arguments using `+--args <file>+` and `+--args0 <file>+`.
+
The new options enable the compiler to read newline and NUL terminated arguments from a specified file name.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.18

The 0.6.18 release primarily includes internal enhancements, and fixes and updates to {proglang}, the {proglang} base library, and Candid. 

The most significant new features and fixes include the following updates:

* A fix to `+dfx upgrade+` that prevents a `+main+` thread panic when `+Option::unwrap()+` is called on a `+None+` value. 
* A fix to the name of the language service command to restore its compatibility with IDEs. 

=== Motoko

* New syntax for option types: _Option blocks_ `do ? <block>` and _option checks_ `<exp> !`.
+
Inside an option block, an option check validates that its operand expression is not `+null+`.
If it is, the entire option block is aborted and evaluates to `+null+`.
This simplifies consecutive null handling by avoiding verbose `+switch+` expressions.
+
For example, the expression `+do? { f(x!, y!) + z!.a }+` evaluates to `+null+` if either `+x+`, `+y+` or `+z+` is `+null+`;
otherwise, it takes the options' contents and ultimately returns `+?r+`, where `+r+` is the result of the addition.

* The argument to a `+do+` or `+do ?+` expression *must* be a block `+{ ... }+`, never a simple expression.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.17

The 0.6.17 release primarily includes user-visible new features, internal enhancements, and fixes and updates to the version of {proglang} and the {proglang} base library that are supported. 

Some of the changes in the release are not backward-compatible and introduce breaking changes that might require you to update all existing projects or to modify {proglang} programs.

The most significant new features and fixes include the following:

* A new DER-based encoding format is used to generate principals. 
This change enhances the security, interoperability, and future features that the Internet Computer can support.
+
This change enables the Internet Computer to support different types of keys, including keys that are most commonly used for web authentication requests and keys that use cryptographic schemes that are better supported by hardware.
The new encoding enables the {IC} to distinguish between the different types of keys that the {IC} supports.
+
This change also requires all principals to be regenerated to use the new encoding.
If you have canisters deployed on the Internet Computer network or have canisters that use an existing principal for access control, you might need to do the following:
+

. Upgrade to the latest SDK release.
. Update your projects to use the new `+dfx+` version.
. Update your applications to use the new principal format, if needed, or to pass it programmatically.
. Recreate and redeploy your canisters.

+
If your canisters are deployed on the {IC} Developer Network (Sodium), you can use the updated canisters that use the new principal for a limited period of time without submitting the new principal or receiving an updated wallet canister.

* To improve security, performance, and flexibility, thereâ€™s a 2MB restriction of the size of update messages. 
In most cases, this restriction should not prevent you from building and deploying applications to run on the Internet Computer. 
However, if you find this limitation hinders your ability to design and deploy canisters, contact DFINITY support with details about your use case and for help resolving the issue.

* You can use an environment variable to configure the root directory for storing the `+.cache+` and `+.config+` subdirectories for `+dfx+`.
+
By default, the `+.cache+` and `+.config+` directories are located in the home directory for your development environment. 
For example, on macOS the default location is in the `+/Users/<YOUR-USER-NAME>+` directory.
You can now use the `+DFX_CONFIG_ROOT+` environment variable to specify a different location for these directories.

* Error handling has been improved.

==== Motoko and Candid updates

The {release} release includes changes to the version of {proglang}, the `+motoko-base+` library, and Candid included with the {sdk-short-name}.
This version of {proglang} includes syntax changes that might require you to update existing programs.

Key updates for {proglang} include support for the following features and changes:

* Simple object literals of the form `+{a = foo(); b = bar()}+` no longer bind to field names locally. 
This change enables you to write expressions like this:
+
....
func foo(x : Nat) { return {x = x} }.
....
+
However, this new syntax breaks short-hand expressions such as:
+
....
`+{a = 1; b = a + 1}+`
....
+
Short-hand expressions like the one above must now be written differently for your program to compile.
For example, you might modify the expression to use an auxiliary declaration like this:
+
....
let a = 1; {a = a; b = a + 1}
....
+
Alternatively, you could modify the program to use long form object syntax like this:
+
....
object {public let a = 1; public let b = a + 1}
....

* Free-standing blocks are no longer allowed.
+
With this release, blocks are only allowed as sub-expressions of control flow expressions such as `+if+`, `+loop+`, and `+case+`.
In all other places, braces are always considered to start an object literal.																													
To use blocks that are not part of control flow expressions, you can use `+do {<block>}+` expressions.
+
In this release, free-standing blocks that are not part of a control flow expressions display a warning but continue to compile.
However, you should update your programs to replace the deprecated syntax to ensure your program continues to compile after the compiler enforces the syntax change.

* Actor declarations are asynchronous and can only be used in asynchronous contexts.
+
The return type of an actor class, if specified, must be an `+async+` actor type.
To support actor declaration, the top-level context of an interpreted program is an asynchronous context, allowing implicit and explicit `+await+` expressions.
+
This change mostly affects interpreted programs and compiled programs with explicit actor class return types.

* Strict checking of `+utf8+` strings for improved Candid compliance.

* More liberal parsing of leb128-encoded numbers

* New `+Random+` library added to `+motoko-base+`.

* Candid includes the ability to extend records with optional fields in a backward-compatible way.

* Injecting a value into an option type (`+? <exp>+`) no longer requires heap allocation in most cases. This removes the memory-tax of using iterators.

For information about known issues that were introduced in previous releases, see <<Known issues and limitations>>.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.14

The 0.6.14 release primarily includes internal enhancements and fixes and updates to the version of {proglang} and the {proglang} base library that are supported. 

There are no user-visible new features in this release. 

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.13

The 0.6.13 release primarily includes internal enhancements and fixes and updates to the version of {proglang} and the {proglang} base library that are supported. 

The only user-visible new feature in this release is the ability to set the default compute and memory allocation settings for a project using the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
Previously, you could only set the compute allocation and memory allocation by specifying command-line options when running the `+dfx canister install+` command.
Note that, although this release includes support for specifying the default compute and memory allocation settings in the `+dfx.json+` file, these keys are not exposed in the `+dfx.json+` template by default. 

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.12

The 0.6.12 release includes both user-visible new features and internal enhancements and fixes. The most significant new features and fixes include the following:

* You can now access the {IC} network running remotely without user name and password credentials using the new `+ic+` network alias.
+
In previous releases, the network alias `+tungsten+` was pre-configured in the project `+dfx.json+` file.
With authorized credentials, you could then use this network alias to access to the {IC} network when running `+dfx+` commands by using the `+--network=tungsten+` option.
+
In this release, the `+ic+` network alias is pre-configured in the project `+dfx.json+` file to replace the `+tungsten+` alias.
In addition, you are no longer required to provide a user name and password as credentials to authenticate your identity.
Instead, you can access the {IC} network when running `+dfx+` commands simply by using the new `+ic+` network alias.
For example, to register, build, and deploy an application on the {IC}, you can run the following command:
+
....
dfx deploy --network=ic
....
+
Note that the `+ic+` network alias is a reserved alias. 
Although you can add other network providers to your `+dfx.json+` file, you cannot use the `+ic+` alias for those providers.
You can, however, use variations on the reserved name such as `+ic-pubs+` or `+ic-examplenet+`.

* Error and status messages are decoded and displayed as human-readable text.
+
Previously, some agent and HTTP error and status messages were returned in an encoded format.
With this release, these agent and HTTP status messages are properly decoded and displayed as human-readable plain text.

* This release of {proglang} improves stability of `+Blob+` and `+Text+` iterators when garbage collection happens.

* This release of {proglang} fixes some erroneous-reported type errors related to using `+break+` in the context of an unconditional `+loop+`.
+
For example, {proglang} supports the following to break out of a loop without type errors: 
+
....
label l : Int loop { break l(42) };
....

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.11

The 0.6.11 release includes both user-visible new features and internal enhancements and fixes. The most significant new features and capabilities include the following:

* You can now specify arguments on the command-line when you deploy a **single** canister using an actor class with the `+dfx deploy+` command.

* Improved handling of `+SIGINT+` and `+SIGTERM+` events ensures that Ctrl-C can now reliably shut down the {IC} network `+replica+` process when running the {IC} locally.

* Enable the `+dfx start+` and `+dfx bootstrap+` commands to start the {IC} using a randomly-selected webserver port.
+
To use a randomly-selected port, you can specify `+0+` as the port when running `+dfx start+` or `+dfx bootstrap+` commands.
For example:
+
....
dfx start --host 192.168.47.1:0
dfx bootstrap --port 0
....

* The `+dfx start+` command now supports specifying the `+--host+` option using the IPv6 address format.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.10

The 0.6.10 release includes both user-visible new features and internal enhancements and fixes. The most significant new features and capabilities include the following:

* You can run the new `+dfx identity get-principal+` command to return the principal associated with the current identity.
+
Note that you must be able to provide a principal identifier for either the `+default+` or a specific identity to deploy or manage applications on the external {IC} network.
+
For more information about getting access to the {IC}, see link:dfinity.org/sodium[Sodium Developer Network onboarding].

* A new `+dfx canister set-controller+` command enables you to specify the identity to use as the new **controller** for a specified canister.
+
When you specify a controller identity, that identity has special rights to manage the canister it controls.
For example, only the controlling identity can be used to install, upgrade, or delete the canister under its control.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.9

The 0.6.9 release includes the following new features and capabilities:

* You can now register, build, and deploy applications with a single command.
+
This release introduces a simplified developer workflow using the the `+dfx deploy+` command. 
You can use this command to replace running the following commands as separate steps:
+
....
dfx canister create --all
dfx build
dfx canister install -all
....
+
For a preview of how to use the simplified developer workflow, see https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/dfx-deploy-quickstart.html[Developer Workflow Preview].

* You can now specify arguments on the command-line when you deploy a **single** canister using an actor class with the `+dfx canister install+` command.
+
For example, you might use the following command to add the `+self+` Text argument when deploying the canister named `+profile_map+` locally.
+
....
dfx canister install profile_map '("self")'
....
+
Note that you specify the argument you want to pass using the Candid interface description format.

* A new `+--memory allocation+` command-line option enables you to specify a memory allocation when deploying a canister.

* The `+dfx identity new+` command has been enhanced to display a confirmation message when adding a new identify is successful.

=== Motoko updates

Key updates for {proglang} include backend support for the following features and changes:

* Preliminary support for importing and exporting actor classes and for dynamic canister installation.
* Improved error handling for actor classes and input/output exceptions.
* The Motoko compiler no longer supports arbitrary declarations preceding the main actor or an actor class. 
Only import declarations can be used as leading declarations for programs that define an actor or an actor class.
+
As a recommended workaround for this change, you can:
+
--
* Move the declarations that preceded the main actor into the actor's body.
* Move the declarations into a new, imported module, referenced from the main actor.
* Use a combination of these strategies.
--
+
For example, if you have a code snippet like this:
+
....
type State = { #red; #orange; #green }
var state : State = #red;
actor TrafficLight { 
  ...
}
....
+
You can modify it like this:
+
....
import Types = "./types"; 
actor TrafficLight { 
  var state : Types.State = #red;
  ...
}
....

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.7

The 0.6.7 release includes the following new features and capabilities:

* The `+dfx build+` command now supports building a specific canister, in addition to building all canisters.
+
For example, you can compile the code for a back-end canister without building the canister used for your project's front-end assets.
+
Because of this change to the `+dfx build+` command, the `+--skip-frontend+` option is no longer needed and has been removed.
* There are several new `+dfx identity+` commands that enable you to create, manage, and switch between different user identities when communicating with the {IC} network.
+
You can also use a new `+--identity+` command-line option to set a specific user context when running `+dfx+` commands. 
+
This new support for multiple identities enables you to test role-based access control for your programs.
* Updates to the Candid argument parser in `+dfx canister call+` include the following user-facing features:
+
** Support type annotations when parsing Candid values. For example, you can use the following syntax to specify types:
+
....
(42: nat8, vec {1;-3;5} : vec int8)
....
** Support for pretty-print decoded Candid values:
+
`+--output pp+` is the default and prints the value in multiple lines.
+
`+--output idl+` prints the value in a single line.
** Support for `+float e+` notation.
** Support for Rust-like parsing errors.
* Key updates for {proglang} include the following:
+
** Support for polymorphic equality that enables the `==` and `!=` operators to work on all shareable types.
** Improvements to catch clashing function and class declarations.
** Language support to enable canisters to take installation arguments. An actor **class** defines a canister that takes an argument on installation.
** Optimized backend handling for `Bool` data types.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.6

The 0.6.6 release features several new commands for managing canisters.
The release include the following new commands for managing canister operations and the canister lifecycle:

- The `+dfx canister status+` command enables you to check whether all canisters or a specific canister in a project are currently running.
- The `+dfx canister stop+` command enables you to stop all canisters or a specific canister in a project to prevent canisters from receiving new requests.
- The `+dfx canister start+` command enables you to restart all canisters or a specific canister in a project so they can resume receiving new requests.
- The `+dfx canister delete+` command enables you to delete all canisters or a specific canister in a project.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.4

The 0.6.4 release primarily included internal improvements that are not user-facing.
The only user-facing features and fixes in the 0.6.4 release are the following:

- A new Reserved type has been added to the JavaScript agent library.
- Fixed the timer that is used in the Candid UI when issuing function calls.

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.3

The 0.6.3 release only included minor fixes and enhancements including the following:

- The `+dfx start --clean+` command has been improved to no longer crash if you run the command in a project that is already in a clean state.
+
Without this fix, manually removing the directories the command is intended to delete would result in `+dfx+` exiting without restarting the {IC}.
- The parsing logic for the `+dfx canister call+` command has been improved to more consistently recognize arguments in Candid format and to return better error messages when argument formats are not recognized.
- The Welcome page displayed when you create a new project has been updated to reflect the current location of SDK and Motoko documentation.

[[highlights]]
=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.2

The 0.6.2 release only included one important user-facing change which was also a breaking change that requires you to update all existing projects.

Starting with the 0.6.2 release, all canister identifiers are generated using a text-based representation.
To work with the {release} release, therefore, you must update your projects to use the new canister identifier format.

If you are connected to the {IC} running locally, do the following in **each project directory**:

. Stop the {IC} by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
. Restart the {IC} in a clean state by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --clean
----
+
This command removes all existing canister state and build output.
. Generate new textual canister identifiers by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----
. Redeploy the updated canisters to use the new text-based identifiers by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.1

The 0.6.1 release only included the following user-facing changes:

- An update to the `+dfx ping+` command enables you to specify a network name to check the status of a network connection.
- An update to the user authentication method enables `+dfx+` to use the browser's `+localStorage+` for the user's public and private keys if cookies are not enabled.
- Motoko programming guidelines are now available as part of the programming language guide on the link:../language-guide/style{outfilesuffix}[SDK website].

=== Highlights of what's new in 0.6.0

The 0.6.0 release included many new features and enhancements.
The following sections describe the key features and enhancements that were introduced in the 0.6.0 release. 

==== SDK

- You can now look up a canister identifier using the command `+dfx canister id <canister_name>+`.
- The `+--check+` flag can be used with the `+dfx build+` command to check whether a canister will build before creating or building the canister.
- Both canister name and canister identifiers are displayed when canisters are created.
- The `+dfx.json+` configuration file has a new fieldâ€”`+defaults/build/packtool+`â€”to support the Vessel package manager.
- The `+dfx.json+` file supports canister new typesâ€”`+motoko+`, `+assets+`, and `+custom+`â€”to allow different build tools to be used for building canisters:
+
** The `+motoko+` canister type uses the `+motoko+` (`+moc+`) compiler to build a canister.
+
** The `+assets+` canister type uses `+npm run build+` by default to build files and uploads them to an asset canister.
+
** The `+custom+` canister type uses a custom builder that should output WebAssembly (WASM) and Candid (DID) files.
- The `+dfx.json+` file includes network mapping for `+local+` and the {IC} network. The local network defaults to `+127.0.0.1:8000+`.

==== Tungsten Developer Network

There are several features that are only applicable for users who have access to the {IC} through the Tungsten Developer Network gateway.
The following features are only applicable if you are granted access to the {IC} through the Tungsten Developer Network gateway:

- User name and password credentials enable HTTP authentication for onboarded users.
- The `+tungsten+` network alias is included as a network in the `+dfx.json+` files.
- You can use the `+dfx ping+` command to ping the Internet Computer network and request its status.
- You can use the `+--network <network>+` command-line option to build and deploy canisters on the on the {IC} network you specify.
- A change to the formatting for the canister identifiers you use to access applications deployed on the {IC} using a web browser.

==== Motoko

- The `+motoko-base+` repository is now open source. You can use the Vessel package manager to download the latest `+base+` libraries directly from the `+master+` branch of the `+motoko-base+` repository.
- Stable variable support.
- The `+mo-doc+` command-line utility enables you to generate documentation directly from Motoko comments.
- Better support for `+Char+` and `+Text+` modules.
- `+Error+` module for rejecting messages.
- `+Buf+` module renamed to `+Buffer+`.

== Breaking changes

In addition to the change described in xref:highlights[Highlights of what's new], the {release} release includes the following changes that might require updates to existing programs:

* If a {proglang} library contains a single actor class, it is imported as a module, which provides access to both the class type and the class constructor function as module components. This change restores the invariant that imported libraries are modules.

* The Motoko compiler no longer supports arbitrary declarations preceding the main actor or an actor class. 

* The command `+dfx new+` now creates a separate assets canister by default. Programs built with earlier versions of the SDK should be converted to this new format.

* You must now register canister identifiers using the `+dfx canister create+` command before building and deploying.

* The `+dfx canister call+` will consult the Candid file for method types. You no longer need to use `+--type string+` or `+--type number+` to specify the argument type. These flags have been deprecated.

== Issues fixed in this release

This section covers the issues fixed in this release.
The {release} release includes internal fixes and improvements to the Candid user interface, the interface description library, and some refactoring of `+dfx+` commands.

- Certification validation error fixed on Linux and NixOS.
- `+dfx stop+` now finds and kills all `+dfx start+` and `+dfx replica+` processes.
- Allow lowercase hex in canister identifiers.
- Allow installation without `+sudo+` when possible.
- Install script issues resolved for Ubuntu and Mac.
- Check added to forbid starting a web server with a forwarded port.
- Cache directory management and error messages.
- Improved error messages for HTTP server errors.

== Known issues and limitations

This section covers any known issues or limitations that might affect how you work with the {sdk-short-name} in specific environments or scenarios.
If there are workarounds to any of the issues described in this section, you can find them in the link:../developers-guide/troubleshooting{outfilesuffix}[Troubleshooting] section.

- Creating a new project displays errors or warnings.
+
By default, creating a new project installs node dependencies to support building a front-end for your project. 
+
Depending on your environment, the installation of node dependencies might display errors or warnings generated by the `+npm+` package manager. 
For example, you might see errors or warnings similar to the following on macOS:
+
....
gyp ERR! configure error 
gyp ERR! stack Error: `gyp` failed with exit code: 1
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onCpExit (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/configure.js:351:16)
