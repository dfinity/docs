:sdk-short-name: DFINITY Canister SDK

Use the `+dfx build+` command to compile your program into a WebAssembly module that can be deployed on the {IC}.
You can use this command to compile all of the programs that are defined for a project in the project's `+dfx.json+` configuration file or a specific canister.

Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure.
For example, if your project name is `+hello_world+`, your current working directory must be the `+hello_world+` top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories.

The `+dfx build+` command looks for the source code to compile using the information you have configured under the `+canisters+` section in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.

== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx build [flag] [option] [--all | canister_name]
----

== Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `+dfx build+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Description

|`+--check+` |Builds canisters using a temporary, hard-coded, locally-defined canister identifier for testing that your program compiles without connecting to the {IC} network.

|`+-h+`, `+--help+` |Displays usage information.

|`+-V+`, `+--version+` |Displays version information.
|===

== Options

You can specify the following option for the `+dfx build+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<36%,<64%",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

|`+--network <network>+` |Specifies the {IC} network you want to connect to. You can use this option to override the network specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.

|===

== Arguments

You can specify the following arguments for the `+dfx build+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<36%,<64%",options="header"]
|===

|Argument |Description

|`+--all+` |Builds all of the canisters configured in the project's `+dfx.json+` file.

|`+canister_name+` |Specifies the name of the canister you want to build.
If you are not using the `+--all+` option, you can continue to use `+dfx build+` or provide a canister name as an argument (the canister name must match at least one name that you have configured in the `+canisters+` section of the `+dfx.json+` configuration file for your project.)

|===

== Examples

You can use the `+dfx build+` command to build one or more WebAssembly modules from the programs specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file under the `+canisters+` key.
For example, if your `+dfx.json+` configuration file defines one `+hello_world+` canister and one `+hello_world_assets+` canister, then running `+dfx build+` compiles two WebAssembly modules:

[source,json]
----
include::example$sample-dfx.json[]
----

Note that the file name and path to the programs on your file system must match the information specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.

In this example, the `+hello_world+` canister contains the main program code and the `+hello_world_assets+` canister store front-end code and assets.
If you want to keep the `+hello_world_assets+` canister defined in the `+dfx.json+` file, but only build the back-end program, you could run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx build hello_world
----

Building a specific canister is useful when you have multiple canisters defined in the dfx.json file, but want to test and debug operations for canisters independently.

To test whether a canister compiles without connecting to any {IC} network, you would run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx build --check
----
