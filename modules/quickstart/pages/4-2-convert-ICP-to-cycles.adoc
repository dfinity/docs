= 4.4 Converting ICP Tokens into Cycles (5 min)

This is option is best for people who have already exhausted the link:developers-guide/default-wallet[cycles wallet] or who want to set up their environment to add more link:developers-guide/concepts/tokens-cycles[cycles] in the future.

== Basic Summary of this Section
To create cycles from ICP, the basic steps:

1. Transfer tokens to the Ledger account controlled by `dfx`
2. Tell IC Ledger convert your ICP tokens into cycles 

== 4.4.1 Transfer Tokens to the Ledger Account Controlled by `dfx` (Terminal B)

When you first installed `dfx`, it created and saved locally "developer identity" which contains ledger `account id`.This is where ICP tokens controlled by `dfx` are stored.  

**1. Find your Ledger `account id`**
[source,bash]
----
dfx ledger account-id
----

Example output
[source,bash]
----
03e3d86f29a069c6f2c5c48e01bc084e4ea18ad02b0eec8fccadf4487183c223
----

**2. Transfer tokens to your Ledger `account id`**

You can acquire ICP tokens in link:https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Managing_ICP_holdings[multiple exchanges].

You can transfer from any exchange, wallet, or link:https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/ICP_custody_with_NNS_frontend_dapp[NNS Frontend dapp] by sending ICP tokens to the `account id` from Step #1 above. For the sake of this tutorial, we recommend sending it 2 ICP tokens.

**3. Confirm there is ICP in the account**

[source,bash]
----
dfx ledger --network ic balance
----

If there is no ICP in the account, the rest of the tutorial will not work.

== 4.4.2 Tell Ledger convert your tokens into cycles (Terminal B)

Now that your `account id` has ICP tokens, we need to tell the Ledger Canister to convert it into cycles for us. 

[source,bash]
----
dfx ledger --network ic create-canister "$(dfx identity get-principal)" --amount 1.998
----

If the transaction is successful, the ledger records the event and you should see output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 3054581
Canister created with id: "gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai"
----

**Save this canister id as you will need it below.**

The canister `gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai` above **is NOT the `Hello` dapp we are creating in this tutorial.** This is a canister created for you and for only one purpose: *hold your cycles and transfer them to your dapps.*

The reason for this new canister is simple: by design, cycles can only be contained within canisters. Since this new "cycle-holding canister" has no other purpose and it referred to as the "cycles wallet". 

image:quickstart/1-cycles-wallet.png[Cycles wallet]

The canister created above (while it does hold cycles) is a generic canister and does not have all the features required from a **"cycles wallet"**, so we will use `dfx` to update it with the code containing all the cycles wallet features: 

In our example, $CYCLES_WALLET_CANISTER_ID is `gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai` so we use the following structure: 

[source,bash]
----
// This is just an example, this will only work with YOUR CYCLE WALLET principal from above
dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet $CYCLES_WALLET_CANISTER_ID
----

In our example, the command would be:

[source,bash]
----
// This is just an example, this will only work with YOUR principal
dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai
----

If the transaction is successful, the ledger records the event and you should see output similar to the following:
[source,bash]
----
Creating a wallet canister on the ic network.
The wallet canister on the "ic" network for user "default" is "gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai"
----

== Conclusion

You have now converted ICP into cycles and stored them in your cycles wallet. You are ready to deploy the dapp on-chain.

Continue with part 4 of the main tutorial: Acquiring Cycles to Deploy On-chain link:4-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Acquiring Cycles to Deploy On-chain].

== Troubleshooting

=== Check your cycles are properly configured with your dfx (Terminal B)

Check that your cycles wallet canister is properly configured and holds the necessary balance of cycles. For this tutorial, make sure you have at least 3 trillion cycles (3000000000000) by running

[source, bash]
----
dfx wallet --network ic balance
----

If you did not convert enough ICP tokens to cycles to complete the operation, you can add cycles to your cycles wallet by running a command similar to the following:

[source, bash]
----
dfx ledger --network ic top-up gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai --amount 1.005
----

This command converts an additional 1.005 ICP tokens to cycles for the `gastn-uqaaa-aaaae-aaafq-cai` cycles wallet created in step 2 of 4.3.2. The command returns output similar to the following:

[source, bash]
----
Transfer sent at BlockHeight: 81520
Canister was topped up!
