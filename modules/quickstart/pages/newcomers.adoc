If this is the first time you are installing developer tools on your computer, you might need to take a few extra steps to prepare your environment.

NOTE: The instructions here assume that you are using a macOS computer.

Before you install the {sdk-short-name}, you need to know:

* How to open and run commands in a terminal
* How to check for and install packages and dependencies
* How to create and navigate to new directories

The steps in this section describe how to prepare a basic development environment.

== Open a terminal

To open the Terminal application on macOS:

. Open the Finder. 
. Click *Applications*, open *Utilities*, then double-click *Terminal*.
+
Alternatively, you can press the kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] keyboard keys to open Search, then type `terminal`.
+
The terminal is where you are going to execute command-line instructions. 
To execute a command, you type or copy and paste an instruction, then press kbd:[Return].
. Check your current path by running the print working directory–`pwd`—command, then pressing kbd:[Return].
+
[source,bash]
----
pwd
----
+
This command displays your current directory with a path like `/Users/<your-user-name>`.
+
After you open the Terminal application, you can open new terminal shell at any time by clicking *Shell*, then selecting *New Window* or *New Tab*.
+
By default, a new terminal shell always opens in your home directory with a path like `/Users/<your-user-name>`.

== Check for packages

The Homebrew application is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install and update packages—that is, external programs—that you need to have available in a local development environment.

The `node.js` package provides a JavaScript runtime environment and modules for front-end user interface development. 
The `node.js` package is not required to build programs, but you'll probably need it if you want to add a graphical user interface to your program.

NOTE: If your development environment is Linux, you can use a package manager of your choice instead of Homebrew to install packages and manage dependencies. 

To check and install packages:

. Check whether you have the Homebrew package manager installed by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
brew --version
----
+
If the command returns version information, continue to the next step.
If Homebrew isn't installed, copy and paste the following command in your terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
----
. Check whether you have the `node.js` package manager installed by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
node --version
----
+
If the command returns version information, continue to <<Create a working folder>>.
If `node.js` isn't installed, copy and paste the following command in your terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
brew install node
----

== Create a working folder

By default, a new terminal shell always opens in your home directory with a path like `/Users/<your-user-name>`.
To keep your workspace tidy, you can create a separate folder for your {IC} projects.

To create a new working folder:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new folder called `ic-projects` in your home directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ic-projects
----
. Change to the new working folder by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ic-projects
----
