# Write code for the Internet Computer

You can get started right away by downloading the DFINITY Canister Software Development Kit (SDK) and cloning an existing sample project or by exploring the documentation. Check out the tiles below to begin building open services and software to run on the Internet Computer.

- [*Get the SDK*](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/download.html) Download the full SDK to write code that runs directly on the internet.
- [*Quick Start*](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart.html) Deploy your first code to the Internet Computer in minutes.
- [*Get Samples*](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sample-apps.html) Access sample code, applications, and microservices.
- [*Developer Tools*](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/introduction-key-concepts.html) Take a deeper dive into how you can use the SDK to create applications.
- [*Language Guide*](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html) Explore Motoko, the  programming language for the Internet Computer.

# Contributing to the documentation

The Internet Computer is a new technology stack that is unhackable, fast, scales to billions of users around the world, and supports a new kind of autonomous software that promises to reverse Big Techâ€™s monopolization of the internet. It allows developers to take on the monopolization of the internet, and return the internet back to its free and open roots. We're committed to connecting those who believe the same through our events, content, and discussions.
