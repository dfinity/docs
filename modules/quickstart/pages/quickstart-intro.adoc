[[quick-start-intro]]
This {sdk-long-name} provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you can create canister smart contract dapps and deploy them on the {IC} blockchain mainnet.
The _Quick Start_ tutorial assumes that you are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time and illustrates how to create, build, and deploy your first dapp. 

== Getting Started
To keep the instructions simple and focused on the task at hand, the _Quick start_ is deliberately hyper-focused in helping you deploy your first smart contract or dapp in 20 minutes or less.

See link:how-to-deploy-hello-world-smart-contract{outfilesuffix}[How to deploy hello world smart contract in 20 minutes].

== More Sample Code

Once you finish your first dap, you can see more robust sample code (e.g. DAOs, NFTs, etc...) in link:../samples/index{outfilesuffix}[Sample code and dapps].
