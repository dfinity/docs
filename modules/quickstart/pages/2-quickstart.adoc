= 2. Create a Dapp Project (1 min)

The SDK comes with a starter default project that has a backend in Motoko and frontend code in HTML, CSS, and JS. Developers can use this default project to start their own dapps. In this tutorial, we will build and deploy this bundled project, so there is no need to download any other dapp code.

The `dfx new hello` command uses the template code to create a new project directory named `hello`, template files, and a new `hello` Git repository for your project. You can create many projects with many names.

This is roughly analogus in Web2 to Rail's `rails new`, React.js's `create-react-app`, or Rust's `cargo new`.

To create a new project for your first application:

== 2.1 Open a Terminal and Create a new project named "hello"

[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----

// Your terminal should look like this:

// image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-1.png[dfx new]

// image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-2.png[dfx new]

== 2.2 Move to your project directory
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

Your directory should look like this:

image:quickstart/cd-hello.png[cd new]

== 2.3 Understanding your dapp project

Your `Hello` dapp project is composed of two canisters

* `hello` canister which contains the template backend logic
* `hello_assets` canister which contains the dapp assets (images, html files, etc)

You may wonder "why two canisters?" These canisters are created for you to help you organize your project. You could have your assets and backend logic in one canister, but IC developers have found that it is useful to create two canisters (one for backend and one for frontend).

== Conclusion

You now have the default project created ready to be deployed locally.
