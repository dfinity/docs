In this tutorial, you are going to write a program that creates a single actor (object) and provides a few basic functions.

For this tutorial, the actor is named `+Counter+`. 
The program uses the `+currentValue+` variable to contain a natural number that represents the current value of the counter. 
This program supports the following types of function calls:

* The `+increment+` function call updates the current value, incrementing by 1 (no return value).
* The `+get+` function call queries and returns the current value.
* The `+set+` function call updates the current value to an arbitrary numeric value you specify as an argument.

This tutorial provides a simple example of how you can increment a counter by calling functions on a deployed canister. 
By calling the function to increment a value multiple times, you can verify that the variable state—that is, the value of the variable between calls—persists.

Like the other sample programs, this tutorial demonstrates a simple, but realistic, workflow in which you perform the following steps:

* Create a new project.
* Write a program that uses {proglang} code.
* Compile the code into a WebAssembly module that you deploy.
* Deploy the canister on the local network client.
* Invoke the canister methods to increment then read the value of a counter.

The following diagram provides a simplified overview of the workflow passing from the developer’s command-line environment to the internet computer network client deployed locally:

As the diagram suggests, the network infrastructure and the development environment co-exist on the same computer in this tutorial.

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the SDK as described in link:../getting-started{outfilesuffix}[Getting started].
* You have stopped any network client processes running on the local computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project directory for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new my_counter
----
+
The command creates a new project, including a default project directory structure under the `+my_counter+` project name and a Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd my_counter
----
[arabic]
. View the top-level directory structure of the new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following if you have `+node.js+` installed in your development environment:
+
[source,bash]
----

== Modify the default configuration

You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to your project directory.
In this tutorial, you will modify the default settings to use a different name for your program directories within your project.

To modify the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor and change the default `+my_counter+` settings to  `+increment_counter+`.
+
For example:
+
[source,json,subs="quotes"]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "my_counter": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/*increment_counter*/public/index.js"
      },
      "main": "src/*increment_counter*/main.mo"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "output": "canisters/"
    },
    "start": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8000,
      "serve_root": "canisters/*increment_counter*/assets"
    }
  },
}
----
+
You can leave the rest of the default settings as they are.
. Save your change and close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.
. Change the name of the source file directory to match the name specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file by running the following command
+
[source,bash]
----
mv src/my_counter/ src/increment_counter/
----

== Modify the default template program

You have already seen that creating a new project creates a default `+src+` directory with a template `+main.mo+` file.
In this tutorial, you modify the template code to create the Counter program.

To modify the default template source code:

. Change to the source code directory for your project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/increment_counter
----
. Open the template `+main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+main.mo+` file:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$counter.mo[]
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Build and deploy the program

You now have a Counter program that you can compile into an executable WebAssembly module and deploy on your local client network.

To build and deploy the program:

. Navigate to the root of your `+my_counter+` project directory.
+
For example, if you have created `+my_counter+` as your project directory in the `+~/ic-projects+` folder, change to that directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects/my_counter
----
. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Building my_counter...
Building frontend code...
----
+
After running the `+dfx build+` command, your program is encapsulated in a unique object—the canister—that can be deployed.
[arabic]
. Verify that the `+canisters/my_counter+` directory created by the `+build+` command contains the WebAssembly and related application files by running the following command.
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l canisters/my_counter
----
. Start the {IC} network client processes by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
. Deploy the canister you created by running a `+dfx canister install+` command and specifying the _canister_name_.
+
For this tutorial, the canister name is `+my_counter+`. 
By substituting `+my_counter+` for the _canister_name_ variable, you can deploy by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install my_counter
----
+
If no error is returned, your canister has been successfully deployed on the local network.

== Invoke methods on the deployed canister

After successfully deploying the canister, you can simulate an end-user invoking the methods provided by the canister. 
For this tutorial, you invoke a `+get+` method to query the value of a counter, an `+increment+` method that increments the counter each time it is called, and a `+set+` method to pass an argument to update the counter to an arbitrary value you specify.

To test invoking methods on the deployed canister:

[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+get+` function, which reads
the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
Note that you could use the `+--async+` option with this command to indicate that you want to poll the client for the result with a separate `+request-status+` call. 
By default, the `+dfx canister call+` command waits for the result rather than requiring you to make a separate `+request-status+` call. 
+
The command returns the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable as zero:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*0*)
----
[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+increment+` function to increment the value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister by one:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment
----
+
This command increments the value of the variable.
[arabic]
. Rerun the following command to get the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get 
----
+
The command returns the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable as one:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*1*)
----
[arabic]
. Run additional commands to experiment with invoking other methods and using different values.
+
For example, try commands similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter set --type number 987 
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
Returns the current value of 987.
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment 
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
Returns the incremented value of 988.

== Stop the local network

. Stop the {IC} processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
