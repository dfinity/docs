Now that you have a basic understanding of how to create, build, and deploy a simple program and are familiar with the default project files and sample front-end, you might want to start experimenting with different ways to customize the front-end user experience for your project.

This tutorial illustrates using a simple React framework to create a new front-end for the default sample program and guides you through some basic modifications to customize the interface displayed. 
Later tutorials expand on the techniques introduced here, but if you already know how to use CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React or other frameworks to build your user interface, you can skip this tutorial.

NOTE: Currently, you can only use Javascript to implement the front-end for your canister. 
This tutorial illustrates using the React framework to manage the Document Object Model (DOM) for your canister.
Because React has its own custom DOM syntax, you need to modify the webpack configuration to compile the front-end code, which is written in JSX. For more information about learning to use React and JSX, see link:https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html[Getting started] on the https://reactjs.org/[React website].

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have `+node.js+` installed for front-end development and can install packages using `+npm install+` in your project.
For information about installing node for your local operating system and package manager, see the link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node] website.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for {proglang} as described in link:../../quickstart/quickstart{outfilesuffix}#install-vscode[Install the language editor plug-in] if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE.

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

== Create a new project

To create a new project directory for your custom front-end application:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Check that you have `+node.js+` installed locally by running the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
which node
which npm
----
+
If you don't have `+node.js+` installed, you should download and install it before continuing to the next step.
For information about installing node for your local operating system and package manager, see the link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node] website.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new custom_greeting
----
+
The `+dfx new custom_greeting+` command creates a new `+custom_greeting+` project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd custom_greeting
----

== Install the React framework

If you've never used React before, you might want to explore the link:https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html[Intro to React] tutorial or the link:https://reactjs.org/[React website] before editing the front-end code.

To install required framework modules:
  
. Install the React module by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save react react-dom
----
. Install the Typescript loader module by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save typescript ts-loader
----

== Modify the default configuration

For this tutorial, you need to modify the default front-end settings in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file for your project.

To modify the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor.
. Notice that the `+canisters+` key includes settings for a `custom_greeting_assets` canister.
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    
    "custom_greeting_assets": {
      "dependencies": [
        "custom_greeting"
      ],
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/custom_greeting_assets/public/index.js",
        "output": "canisters/custom_greeting_assets/assets"
      },
      "source": [
        "src/custom_greeting_assets/assets"
      ],
      "type": "assets"
    }
  }
}
----
+
Let's take a look at the settings in this section.
+
--
* Front-end assets for your project are compiled into their own canister, in this case, a canister named `+custom_greeting_assets+`. 

* The assets canister has a default dependency on the main canister for the project. 

* The `+frontend.entrypoint+` setting specifies the path to a file—in this case, the `+index.js+` file—to use as your application entry point.
If you had a different starting point—for example, a custom `index.html` file—you would modify this setting.

* The `+source+` setting specifies the path to a directory for static assets that will be included in your assets canister when you build your project.
If you had custom cascading stylesheet (CSS) or JavaScript files, you would include them in this source folder.
After building the project, these assets are served from the directory specified by the `+frontend.output+` setting. 

* The `+type+` setting specifies that the `+custom_greeting_assets+` is an asset canister rather than a program canister.
--
+
For this tutorial, change the `+entrypoint+` file name to `+index.jsx+` to enable adding HTML directly inside Javascript as a template.
. Close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.

== Review the default program

For this tutorial, you are going to use the default `+main.mo+` file.
Later, you can return to this file and make changes to see how you can use the front-end to reflect changes in your program code.

To review the default program"

. Change to the `+src/custom_greeting+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/custom_greeting
----
. Open the `+main.mo+` file to review the default code.
+
The default program consists of one actor, one `+greet+` function, and one `+name+` argument.
As you saw in link:default-frontend[Viewing the default front-end], the default front-end for this program uses a few lines of raw JavaScript to place the `+greet+` function and returned `+name+` argument a simple alert window.
. Close the `+main.mo+` file to continue.

== Modify the front-end files

You are now ready to create a new front-end for the default program.

To prepare the front-end files:

. Navigate back to the root of your project directory.
. Open the webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) in a text editor to add the following `+module+` key above the `+plugins+` section:
+
[source,json]
----
module: {
  rules: [
    { test: /\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: "ts-loader" }
  ]
},
----
+
This setting enables the program to use the `+ts-loader+` compiler for the `+index.jsx+` file.
. Create a new file named `+tsconfig.json+` in your project directory, open the file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following into the file:
+
[source,json]
----
include::example$custom-frontend-tsconfig.json[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+tsconfig.json+` file to continue.
. Change to the `+src/custom_greeting_assets/public+` directory.
. Open the default `+index.js+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+index.js+` file:
+
[source,react]
----
include::example$react-index.jsx[]
----
. Rename the modified `index.js` file as `index.jsx` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv index.js index.jsx
----

== Start the local network

Before you can build the `+custom_greeting+` project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, click *Shell*, select *New Window*, then run the following command in the new terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects/custom_greeting
----
+
You should now have two terminal windows open with your project directory as your current working directory.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
After you start the local network, this terminal displays messages about network operations.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project.

== Build and deploy the program

You are now ready to compile the program with the new front-end into a WebAssembly module for your project.

To build and deploy the program with the new front-end:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Navigate to the root of your `+custom_greeting+` project folder.
. Build the executable canister by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
The command displays output indicating that the build is successful.
+
[source,bash]
----
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
----
. Deploy your `+custom_greeting+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----
+
The command output displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Installing code for canister custom_greeting, with canister_id ic:100000000000000000000000000000000001A9
Installing code for canister custom_greeting_assets, with canister_id ic:11000000000000000000000000000000000183
----
. Copy the canister identifier for the `+custom_greeting_assets+` canister to the clipboard or a notepad application.

== View the new front-end

You can now access the new front-end for the default program by entering the canister identifier for the assets canister in a browser.

To view the custom front-end:

. Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
By default, the URL uses the localhost address (`+127.0.0.1+`) and port number `+8000+`, so you can navigate to the front-end for the custom_greeting program using `+127.0.0.1:8000+` for the URL.
+
In addition to the host and port, the URL you specify needs to include `+canisterId+` parameter to identify the canister that you want the web server to display. 
To specify the canister, append the identifier using the following syntax:
+
[source,bash]
----
?canisterId=ic:canister_identifier
----
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the `+ic:_canister_identifier_+` that was returned for the `+custom_greeting_assets+` canister when you ran the `+dfx canister install+` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=ic:11000000000000000000000000000000000183
----
. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:react-greeting.png[Sample front-end]
. Replace *Name* in the input field with the text you want to display, then click *Get Greeting* to see the result.
+
For example:
+
image:greeting-response.png[Greeting result]

== Revise the front-end and test your changes

After viewing the front-end, you might want to make some changes.

To modify the front-end:

. Open the `index.jsx` file in a text editor and modify its style settings.
For example, you might want to change the font family and use a placeholder for the input field by making changes similar to the following:
+
[source,react]
....
include::example$react-revised-index.jsx[]
....
. Rebuild the project with your changes by running the following command.
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Deploy your project changes by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all --mode reinstall
----
. View the results in the browser by reloading the page that displays the custom_greeting_assets canister.
+
For example:
+
image:revised-greeting.png[Modified styles on your entry page]
. Type a new message and see your new greeting.
For example:
+
image:modified-result.png[Modified greeting result]

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with the front-end for your program, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
