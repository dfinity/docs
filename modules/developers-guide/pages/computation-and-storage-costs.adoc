= Computation and Storage Costs
:proglang: Motoko
:IC: Internet Computer
:company-id: DFINITY

The {IC} requires computation operations and storage to be funded by cycles. Cycles are generated from the conversion of Internet Computer (ICP) utility tokens.  


== The Role of the Network Nervous System (NNS) in Defining Costs

The {IC} is a decentralized public utility, controlled by the NNS –– the network’s open, algorithmic governance system. The NNS fundamentally controls how many cycles are required for low-level computation actions for computation and storage. The number of cycles needed for individual computations will vary based on a number of factors considered by the NNS, including proposals from the community.  


== Details: Cost of Compute and Storage Transactions on the {IC}
