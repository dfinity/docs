= Working with different languages
:cpp: C++

Most of the examples in this guide use {proglang}—the programming language specifically designed to work with the {IC}. 
Potentially, however, you can write programs in any language that compiles to WebAssembly to deploy applications that run on the {IC}.
This section provides some high-level guidance for writing programs in different languages and how to deploy them on the {IC}.

== Using Rust

You can create Rust projects to run on the {IC} by using Cargo and compiling your program to use WebAssembly as the target output.
The CanCan sample project illustrates one way of implementing a Rust-based canister—the `+BigMap+` library—using macros to write functions as query and update calls.

This section provides a summary of the key steps involved in deploying a Rust program as a canister on the {IC}.
You should note, however, that the steps described here only illustrate one approach. 
Other implementation approaches are also possible. 
////
The Rust CDK provides some shortcuts to make it easier to write functions as query and update calls, but you can develop applications for the {IC} without using the Rust CDK.

=== Create a project

Because most Rust programmers use Cargo to handle build and package management tasks—such as downloading and compiling the libraries your program depends on—your first step is to create a new Rust project using the Cargo command-line interface.

Alternatively, you could create a new project using {sdk-long-name} instead of Cargo, but creating a project using Cargo represents the typical workflow for creating Rust projects.

To create a new Rust project:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already
have one open.
. Verify that you have Cargo installed by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cargo --version
----
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} or Rust sample projects.
. Create a new project by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
cargo new my_rust_program
----
+
This command creates a new `+my_rust_program+` directory with a default `+Cargo.toml+` file and a `+src+` directory with a default `+main.rs+` file.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd my_rust_program
----
+
If you list the contents of this directory, you'll see that it only contains the `+Cargo.toml+` file and `+src+` directory. 
To compile this project to run on the {IC}, you'll need some additional files.

=== Modify the Cargo configuration file

The `+Cargo.toml+` file provides a *manifest* for each Rust package. 
The manifest contains sections that specify configuration details for the package.
To prepare the Rust project to run on the {IC}, we'll copy the default `+Cargo.toml+` file then modify some of the configuration details for the project.

To modify the `+Cargo.toml+` file:

. Check that you are in the root directory for your project by running the `+pwd+` command, if necessary.
. Copy the default `+Cargo.toml+` file to the `+src+` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,toml]
----
cp Cargo.toml src/Cargo.toml
----
+
Projects that run on the {IC} typically use one project-level `+Cargo.toml+` file to set up a workspace for the canister members of the project and a second `+Cargo.toml+` file in the source code directory to configure settings for each canister.
. Open the `+Cargo.toml+` file that is the root directory of your project in a text editor. 
+
By default, the file contains the `+[package]+` and the `+[dependencies]+` sections.
. Replace the `+[package]+` section with a `+[workspace]+` section similar to the following:
+
[source,toml]
----
[workspace]
members = [
    "src/my_rust_program",
]
----
+
For information about the `+[workspace]+` section and `+[workspace]+` keys, see link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html[Workspaces].
For information about the other sections and keys you can configure in the `+Cargo.toml+` file, see link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html[The Manifest Format].
. Remove the `+[dependencies]+` section.
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.
. Open the `+src/Cargo.toml+` file in a text editor.
. Add a `+[lib]+` section with the path to the main source code similar to the following: 
+
[source,toml]
----
[lib]
path = "main.rs"
----
. Update the `+[dependencies]+` section with any package dependencies.
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Add a canister configuration file

When you create a new project using the {sdk-short-name}, the `+dfx new+` command automatically adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to the project directory.
Because we created the Rust project using Cargo, you need to manually create this file in your project directory.

To add the `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Check that you are still in your project directory by running the `+pwd+` command, if necessary.
. Create a new `+dfx.json+` configuration file in the root directory for your project.
. Open the `+dfx.json+`file in a text editor.
. Add the `+version+` and `+canisters+` keys with settings similar to the following to the `+dfx.json+` file:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "version": 1,
  "canisters": {
    "my_rust_program": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "src/my_rust_program.did",
      "wasm": "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/my_rust_program.wasm",
      "build": "cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --package my_rust_program"
    }
  }
}
----
+
Let's take a closer look at these settings.
+
--
* The `+version+` setting is used to identify the version of the software used to create the project.
* The `+canisters+` section specifies the name of the project's canisters.
In this case, there's only one canister and it is named `+my_rust_program+`.
* The `+type+` key is set to `+custom+` because this canister is not one of the currently recognized (`+motoko+` or `+assets+`) canister types.
* The `+candid+` key specifies the name and location of the Candid interface description file to use for this project.
* The `+wasm+` key specifies the path to the WebAssembly file generated by the `+cargo build+` command.
* The `+build+` key specifies the `+cargo+` command used to compile the output.
--
+
These are the minimum settings required.
As you build more complex programs, you might need to include additional configuration details in the `+Cargo.toml+` file, the `+dfx.json+` file, or both files.
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Create a Candid interface description file

In addition to the `+dfx.json+` configuration file, you need to have a Candid interface description file—for example, `+my_rust_program.did+`—to map your program's input parameters and return value formats to their language-agnostic representation in Candid.

To add the Candid interface description file:

. Check that you are still in your project directory by running the `+pwd+` command, if necessary.
. Create a new Candid interface description file—for example, `+my_rust_program.did+`—in the `+src+` directory for your project.
. Open the Candid interface description file in a text editor and add a description for each function the program defines.
+
For example, if the `+my_rust_program+` is a simple program that increments a counter using the `+increment+`, `+read+`, and `+write+` functions, the `+my_rust_program.did+` file might look like this:
+
[source,candid]
----
service : {
  "increment": () -> ();
  "read": () -> (nat) query;
  "write": (nat) -> ();
}
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Modify the default program

When you create a new project, your project `+src+` directory includes a template `+main.rs+` file with the "Hello, World!" program.

To modify the template source code:

. Open the template `+src/main.rs+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Write the program you want to deploy on the {IC}.
+
As you write your program, keep in mind that there are two types of calls—update calls and query calls—and that update functions use asynchronous messaging.
. Save your changes and close the `+main.rs+` file.

=== Connect to a network and deploy

Before you can deploy and test your program, you need to do the following:

* Connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.
* Register a network-specific identifier for the application
* Compile the program with a target output of WebAssembly.

Because you configured the custom `+dfx.json+` file with a `+cargo build+` command that compiles to WebAssembly, you can use the `+dfx+` command-line interface and standard work flow to perform all of the remaining steps.

To build and deploy the program locally:

. Check that you are still in your project directory by running the `+pwd+` command, if necessary.
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer and navigate to your project directory.
+
For example, you can do either of the following if running Terminal on macOS:
+
--
* Click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
* Click *Shell* and select *New Window*, then run `+cd ~/ic-projects/location_hello+` in the new terminal if your `+location_hello+` project is in the `+ic-projects+` working folder.
--
+
You should now have two terminals open with your project directory as your current working directory**.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. 
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your project.
. Build the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Register a unique canister identifier for the application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----
. Deploy the program on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----
. Test functions in the program from the command-line or in a browser.

== Using C

Because the {IC} supports applications compiled to standard WebAssembly modules, you can use standard compilers and toolchains to build applications in languages such as  C, {cpp}, Objective-C, and Objective-{cpp} programming languages and the `+Clang+` compiler.

To illustrate how to migrate programs written in C to run on the {IC}, let’s look at the simple `+reverse.c+` program in the link:https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/c[examples] repository. 
The `+reverse.c+` program contains one function—named `+go+`—that reverses a string in place.

=== Set up the development environment

To compile the `+reverse.c+` program into WebAssembly, you need to have the `+clang+` compiler and standard libraries installed. 
You can check whether you have `+clang+` installed on your local computer by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
clang --version
----

If `+clang+` is installed, the command displays information similar to the following:

....
clang version 10.0.0 
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin19.5.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin
....

If the command doesn’t return version information, install `+clang+` before continuing. 
The steps to install `+clang+` vary depending on the operating system you are using.
On Debian Linux, for example, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install clang lld gcc-multilib
----

On macOS, you can install `+clang+` by installing the Developer Command-Line Tools or by installing LLVM using Homebrew. 
For example, if `+clang+` is not installed, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
brew install llvm
----

=== Compile the program into WebAssembly

You can compile a C program to run as a WebAssembly module by first compiling using `+clang+`, then linking using `+wasm-ld+`. 
Depending on the operating system and version of `+clang+` you are using, you might use a different version of the WebAssembly linker, such as `+wasm-ld+` on macOS or `+wasm-ld-8+` on Debian. 
 
To compile to WebAssembly on macOS:
 
. Compile the program by running the following clang command:
+
[source,bash]
----
clang --target=wasm32 -c -O3 reverse.c
----
. Run the linker to create the WebAssembly module by running the following `+wasm-ld+` command:
+
[source,bash]
----
wasm-ld --no-entry --export-dynamic --allow-undefined reverse.o -o reverse.wasm
----

=== Create a minimal configuration file

Next, you need to prepare a simple configuration file that identifies the `+reverse+` program binary as a package that can be installed on the {IC} and a `+build+` directory so that you can use the `+dfx+` command-line interface to install and run the package as a canister.

To prepare a configuration file and build directory:

. Create a `+dfx.json+` file with a canisters key by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
echo '{"canisters":{"reverse":{"main":"reverse"}}}' > dfx.json
----
. Create a `+build+` directory for the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir build
----
. Create a `+reverse+` directory for the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir build/reverse
----
. Copy the WebAssembly modules to the new `+build/reverse+` directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cp reverse.wasm build/reverse/
----

=== Create a minimal interface description file

In a standard development workflow, running the `+dfx build+` command creates several files in the `+canisters+` output directory, including one or more Candid interface description (`+.did+`) files that handle type matching for the data types associated with a program’s functions.

For details about the syntax to use for different data types, see the link:../candid-spec/IDL{outfilesuffix}[Candid specification].

To create a Candid interface description file for this program:

. Open a terminal in the `+build+` directory you created for the `+reverse.c+` program source
. Create a new text file named `+reverse.did+`.
. Add a description of the `+go+` function.
+
For example:
+
[source.bash]
----
service : {
  "go": (text) -> (text);
}
----
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

=== Deploy and test the program

Before you can deploy and test your program, you need to do the following:

* Connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.
* Register a network-specific identifier for the application.

To deploy and test the application locally:

. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer.
+
For example, if running Terminal on macOS,click *Shell*, then select *New Tab* to open a new terminal in your current working directory.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer in your second terminal by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
. Register a unique canister identifier for the `+reverse+` application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----
. Deploy the default program on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all
----
. Call the `+go+` function in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call reverse go repaid
("diaper")
----
