= Import library modules

In this tutorial, you are going to write a simple dapp that enables you to store and look up telephone numbers.
This tutorial illustrates how to import and use a few basic {proglang} library functions.

For this tutorial, the {proglang} base library functions are defined in the  `+List+` and `+AssocList+` modules and enable you to work with lists as linked key-value pairs.
In this example, the *key* is a `+name+` and the *value* is the `+phone+` text string associated with that name.

This dapp supports the following function calls:

* The `+insert+` function accepts the `+name+` and `+phone+` key-value pair as input stored in the `+book+` variable.
* The `+lookup+` function is a query that uses the specified `+name+` key as input to find the associated phone number.

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].
* You have stopped all replica processes involved in emulating a local network for development purposes.

This tutorial takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already
have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} projects, if you are using one.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new phonebook
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd phonebook
----

== Modify the default dapp

For this tutorial, let's create a new `+main.mo+` file for the simple phone number lookup dapp.

To modify the default template:

. Open the `+src/phonebook/main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+main.mo+` file:
+
[source.copy,motoko,no-repl]
----
include::example$phonebook.mo[]
----
+
In looking at this sample dapp, you might notice the following key elements:
+
--

* The code defines `+Name+` and `+Phone+` as custom Text types.
Creating user-defined types improves the readability of the code.

* The `+insert+` function is an update call and the `+lookup+` function is a query call.

* The `+Phone+` type is identified as an optional value by using the `+?Phone+` syntax.
--

== Start the local network

For development purposes `dfx` can emulate an {IC} network locally. This requires a `+dfx.json+` file, so you should be sure you are in your project's root directory. For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see the output of the processes related to locally emulating the network in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the local {IC} network emulator:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer.
. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary.
+
--
* You should now have **two terminals** open.
* You should have the **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
--
. Start the {IC} network emulator on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --clean
----
+
For this tutorial, we're using the `+--clean+` option to start the {IC} network emulator in a clean state.
+
This option removes any orphan background processes or canister smart contract identifiers that might disrupt normal operations.
For example, if you forgot to issue a `+dfx stop+` when moving between projects, you might have a process running in the background or in another terminal. 
The `+--clean+` option ensures that you can start the {IC} network emulator and continue to the next step without manually finding and terminating any running processes.
. Leave the terminal that displays local network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project.

== Register, build, and deploy the dapp

Once the {IC} network emulator is up and running locally in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your dapp to the emulator.

To deploy the dapp locally:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Register, build, and deploy your dapp locally by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy phonebook
----
The `+dfx.json+` file provides default settings for creating a dapp front-end entry point and `+assets+` canister smart contract.
+
In previous tutorials, we deleted the entries for the asset canister because we were not adding a front-end for the sample dapp. That change kept our project workspace tidy by eliminating files that would go unused. There is no requirement to do this, however, and there is no harm in leaving the asset canister smart contract description in the `dfx.json` file. For example, you might want to use it as a placeholder if you intend to add front-end assets later.
+
For this tutorial, you can deploy just the phonebook back-end canister smart contract using the `+dfx deploy phonebook+` command because the project doesn't include any front-end assets and you will interact with it via the terminal.
+
Although this tutorial illustrates how to skip compiling a front-end canister, you can add a simple user interface to this dapp later by exploring the link:https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/phone-book[phone-book] project in the link:https://github.com/dfinity/examples[examples] repository.

== Add names and numbers using the insert function

You now have a dapp deployed as a *canister smart contract* on your local network emulator and can test your dapp by using `+dfx canister call+` commands.

To test the dapp you have deployed on the local network emulator:

. Use the `+dfx canister call+` command to call the canister smart contract `+phonebook+` using the `+insert+` function and pass it a name and phone number by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook insert '("Chris Lynn", "01 415 792 1333")'
----
. Add a second name and number pair by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook insert '("Maya Garcia", "01 408 395 7276")'
----
. Verify that the command returns the number associated with "Chris Lynn" using the `+lookup+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("Chris Lynn")'
----
+
The command returns output similar to the following:
+
....
(opt "01 415 792 1333")
....
+
. Try to call the `+lookup+` function with the number associated with "Maya Garcia" by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("01 408 395 7276")'
----
+
Note that, in this case, the command returns `+(null)+` because the phone number is not a key associated with the "Maya Garcia" name entry.
. Try to call the `+lookup+` function again to return the phone numbers for both "Maya Garcia" and "Chris Lynn" by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call phonebook lookup '("Maya Garcia","Chris Lynn")'
----
+
Because the dapp is written to return one value for one key, the command only returns information associated with the first key, in this example the phone number for `+Maya Garcia+`.

== Revise the source code in your dapp

To extend what you have learned in this tutorial, you might want to try modifying the source code to return different results.

For example, you might want to change the source code so that instead of a dapp that inserts and looks up a current key-value (name-phone) pair to create a dapp that stores contact information similar to a database "record" in which a primary key is associated with multiple fields.
In this example, your dapp might enable users or another dapp to add information—such as a home phone number, a cell phone number, an email address, and a street address—and selectively return all or specific field values.

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with your dapp, you can stop the local {IC} network emulator so that it does not continue running in the background.

To stop the local network emulator:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the local network emulator by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
