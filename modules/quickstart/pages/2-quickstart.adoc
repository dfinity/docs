== 2. Create a Default Project (1 min)

=== 2.1 Launch a new project 

Dapps on the Internet Computer start as projects, which are initiated using the dfx parent command and its subcommands. Projects are created using the `dfx` parent command and its subcommands. This tutorial starts with the default sample dapp to illustrate how to create a dapp using the starter files in a project. When you create a new project, the `dfx` command-line interface adds a default project directory structure to your workspace.

To create a new project for your first application:

=== 2.2 Open a terminal shell on your computer and create a new project named "hello"

[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----

The `dfx new hello` command creates a new project directory named `hello`, template files, and a new `hello` Git repository for your project. Your terminal should look like this:

image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-2.png[dfx new]

=== 2.3 Move to your project directory
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

Your directory should look like this:

image:quickstart/cd-hello.png[cd new]

== 2.4 Understanding your dapp project

Your `Hello` dapp project is composed of two canister smart contracts.

* `hello` canister which contains your backend logic
* `hello_assets` canister which contains your assets

You may wonder "why two canisters?" These canisters are created for you to help you organize your project. You could have your assets and backend logic in one canister, but IC developers have found that it is useful to create two canisters (one for backend and one for frontend).

== Conclusion

You now have the default project created ready to be deployed locally.
