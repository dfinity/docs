[[quick-start-intro]]
This {sdk-long-name} is an Alpha release that provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you create programs to run on a *locally-deployed* {IC} replica node.

IMPORTANT: For this *Alpha* release, only *macOS* and *Linux* platforms are supported. In addition, you won’t be able to install your programs on an externally-managed Developer Network just yet, but that capability is coming soon.

By developing programs that run on the {platform}, you can deploy secure, tamper-proof applications and provide web-based services without the restrictions or expense of a proprietary infrastructure, the complexities of database management and maintenance, or the investment in hardware required to run enterprise-scale software.

If you want to learn more about the {platform} and how it can transform distributed computing and the application landscape, check out link:https://dfinity.org/faq[Frequently Asked Questions] or the videos posted on the https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOyguKlTxoDK3HRzmGbLyAg[DFINITY Official Youtube Channel].

If you are ready to start developing applications that run on the {platform}, it only takes a few minutes to get up and running.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install this release of the SDK, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.
* You should have `+node.js+` installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.

[[download-and-install]]
== Download and install

The most straightforward option for accessing the {sdk-long-name} is to download the SDK package from within a terminal shell on your local computer.
With this installation option, you can be logged on as any user and no additional software is required.

To download and install from a terminal shell:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, on macOS open the Applications folder, then open Utilities
and double-click *Terminal*.
. Download and install the SDK package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the `+dfx+` command-line interface executable and its dependencies on your local computer.
. Review the license agreement, then type `+y+` and press Enter if you want to continue with the installation.
+
[source,bash]
----
Do you agree and wish to install the DFINITY ALPHA SDK [y/N]?
----
+ The default response is No.
You must type `+y+` and press Enter to continue.
+
The command displays information about the components being installed on the local computer.

[[verify-the-sdk-is-ready-to-use]]
== Verify the SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the {platform}  will be available on your local computer.

To verify the SDK is ready to use:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already
have one open.
. Check that you have the SDK developer command-line interface installed and the executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the developer command-line interface similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx 0.5.4
----
. Preview usage information for the other developer command-line interface sub-commands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----
+
The command displays usage information for the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project

You are now ready to create a new project for your first sample application.

To create a new project directory for your first application:

[arabic]
. Create a new project directory for your first application by running the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----
+
The `+dfx new hello+` command creates a new `+hello+` project with a default project directory, some template files, and a new Git repository for your project.
+
If you have `+node.js+` installed locally, creating a new project also adds some template front-end code and dependencies.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

[[build-the-project]]
== Build the program

Your new `+hello+` project includes a simple default program in the `+src/hello+` directory that you can compile.

To build the program executable:

. View the contents of the source directory for your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l src/hello
----
+
Note that the `src/hello` directory includes a default `+main.mo+` program for your project and a `+public+` directory.
For this _Quick start_, you only need to use the `+main.mo+` program.
. Build the executable from the default `+main.mo+` file by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Verify the command displays output indicating that the build is successful.
+
For example, if you have `+node.js+` installed you should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Building canister hello
Building frontend
Bundling frontend assets in the canister
----

[[start-the-local-network-and-deploy]]
== Start the local network and deploy

You now have a program that can be deployed on your local replica network.

[arabic]
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. 
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
+
The `+--background+` option starts {IC} replica processes then runs them in the background so that you can continue to the next step without opening another terminal shell on your local computer.
. Deploy the default program on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install hello
----
+
You should see an installation confirmation message for your canister similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Installing code for canister hello, with canister_id ic:795EA5F537665EED24
Mar 04 15:35:16.710 INFO Successfully inserted an
ingress message into IngressPool, Application:
ArtifactPool
Mar 04 15:35:17.968 INFO Created checkpoint @168961 
in 76.82103ms, StateManager: 1
----
. Call the predefined `+greet+` method in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello greet "there" --type string
----
+
This example uses the `+dfx canister call+` command to pass "there" as an argument of type `+string+` to the `+greet+` function.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function (Hello, there!).
+
For example:
+
[source,bash, subs="quotes"]
----
Mar 04 15:43:51.826 INFO Successfully inserted an
ingress message into IngressPool, Application:
ArtifactPool
Mar 04 15:43:52.779 INFO Created checkpoint @169984 
in 68.44148ms, StateManager: 1
(*"Hello, there!"*)
----
. Stop the {IC} replica processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
