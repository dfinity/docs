This section serves as a technical reference for the previous chapters and has specific technical information for readers with specific interests.
For example, this section provides technical details of interest to the following audiences:

  - Authors providing the higher-level documentation about the {proglang} programming language.
  - Compiler experts interested in the details of {proglang} and its compiler.
  - Advanced programmers who want to learn more about the lower-level details of {proglang}.

This part strives to be complete as a reference manual, but _not_
instructive or overly-accessible for newcomers.

[[syntax]]
== Program syntax

[[syntax-whitespace]]
=== Whitespace

Space, newline, horizontal tab, carriage return, line feed and form feed
are considered as whitespace. Whitespace is ignored
but used to separate adjacent keywords, identifiers and operators.

In the definition of some lexemes, we use the symbol `‚ê£` to denote a single whitespace character.

[[syntax-comments]]
=== Comments

Single line comments are all characters following ``//`` until the end of the same line.

  // single line comment
  x = 1

Single or multi-line comments are any sequence of characters delimited by `+/*+` and  `+*/+`:

  /* multi-line comments
     look like this, as in C and friends */

Comments delimited by `+/*+` and `+*/+` may be nested, provided the nesting is well-bracketed.

All comments are treated as whitespace.

[[syntax-keywords]]
=== Keywords

The following keywords are reserved and may not be used as identifiers:

```bnf
actor and assert assert await break case catch class continue debug
debug_show else false for func if ignore in import not null object or
label let loop private public query return shared switch true try
type var while
```

[[syntax-programs]]
=== Programs

```bnf
<prog> ::=  programs
  <dec>;*

```

[[syntax-decls]]
=== Declaration syntax

The syntax of a _declaration_ is as follows:

```bnf
<dec> ::=                                                                declaration
  <exp>                                                                    expression
  ignore <exp>                                                             ignore
  let <pat> = <exp>                                                        immutable
  var <id> (: <typ>)? = <exp>                                              mutable
  <sort> <id>? =? { <dec-field>;* }                                        object
  <shared-pat>? func <id>? <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>         function
  type <id> <typ-params>? = <typ>                                          type
  <sort>? class <id> <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? { <exp-field>;* }   class
```

```bnf
<shared-pat> ::=                  shared function qualifer with call-context pattern
  shared query? <pat>?
```

For `<shared-pat>`, an absent `<pat>?` is shorthand for the wildcard pattern `_`.


```bnf
<dec-field> ::=                                object declaration fields
  (public|private)? <dec>                        field
```


[[syntax-ids]]
=== Identifiers

Identifiers are alpha-numeric, start with a letter and may contain underscores:

```bnf
<id>   ::= Letter (Letter | Digit | _)*
Letter ::= A..Z | a..z
Digit  ::= 0..9
```

[[syntax-expressions]]
=== Expression syntax

The syntax of an _expression_ is as follows:

```bnf
<exp> ::=                                      expressions

  switch <exp> { (case <pat> <exp>;)+ }          switch
  while <exp> <exp>                              while loop
  loop <exp> (while <exp>)?                      loop
  for ( <pat> in <exp> ) <exp>                   iteration

  ( <exp> )                                      parentheses
```

[[syntax-patterns]]
=== Patterns

The syntax of a _pattern_ is as follows:

```bnf
<pat> ::=                                      patterns
  _                                              wildcard
  <id>                                           variable
  <unop>? <lit>                                  literal
  ( <pat>,* )                                    tuple or brackets
  { <pat-field>;* }                              object pattern
  # <id> <pat>?                                  variant pattern
  ? <pat>                                        option
  <pat> : <typ>                                  type annotation
  <pat> or <pat>                                 disjunctive pattern

<pat-field> ::=                                object pattern fields
  <id> = <pat>                                   field
```

[[syntax-integers]]
=== Integers

Integers are written as decimal or hexadecimal, `Ox`-prefixed natural numbers.
Subsequent digits may be prefixed a single, semantically irrelevant, underscore.

```bnf
digit ::= ['0'-'9']
hexdigit ::= ['0'-'9''a'-'f''A'-'F']
num ::= digit ('_'? digit)*
hexnum ::= hexdigit ('_'? hexdigit)*
nat ::= num | "0x" hexnum
```

Negative integers may be constructed by applying a prefix negation `-` operation.

[[syntax-chars]]
=== Characters

A character is a single quote (`'`) delimited:
* Unicode character in UTF-8,
* `\`-escaped  newline, carriage return, tab, single or double quotation mark
* `\`-prefixed ASCII character (TBR),
* or  `\u{` hexnum `}` enclosed valid, escaped Unicode character in hexadecimal (TBR).

```bnf
ascii ::= ['\x00'-'\x7f']
ascii_no_nl ::= ['\x00'-'\x09''\x0b'-'\x7f']
utf8cont ::= ['\x80'-'\xbf']
utf8enc ::=
    ['\xc2'-'\xdf'] utf8cont
  | ['\xe0'] ['\xa0'-'\xbf'] utf8cont
  | ['\xed'] ['\x80'-'\x9f'] utf8cont
  | ['\xe1'-'\xec''\xee'-'\xef'] utf8cont utf8cont
  | ['\xf0'] ['\x90'-'\xbf'] utf8cont utf8cont
  | ['\xf4'] ['\x80'-'\x8f'] utf8cont utf8cont
  | ['\xf1'-'\xf3'] utf8cont utf8cont utf8cont
utf8 ::= ascii | utf8enc
utf8_no_nl ::= ascii_no_nl | utf8enc

escape ::= ['n''r''t''\\''\'''\"']

character ::=
  | [^'"''\\''\x00'-'\x1f''\x7f'-'\xff']
  | utf8enc
  | '\\'escape
  | '\\'hexdigit hexdigit
  | "\\u{" hexnum '}'

char := '\'' character '\''
```

[[syntax-text]]
=== Text

A text literal is `"`-delimited sequence of characters:

```bnf
text ::= '"' character* '"'
```


[[syntax-literals]]
=== Literals

```bnf
<lit> ::=                                     literals
  <nat>                                         natural
  <float>                                       float
  <char>                                        character
  <text>                                        Unicode text
```

Literals are constant values. The syntactic validity of a literal depends on the precision of the type at which it is used.



[[syntax-ops]]
== Operators and types

[[syntax-ops-cats]]
=== Categories

To simplify the presentation of available operators, operators and primitive types are classified into basic categories:

|===
| Abbreviation | Category |

| A            | Arithmetic | arithmetic operations
| L            | Logical    | logical/Boolean operations
| B            | Bitwise    | bitwise operations
| R            | Relational | equality and comparison
| T            | Text       | concatenation
|===

Some types have several categories, e.g. type `Int` is both arithmetic (A) and relational \(R) and supports both arithmetic addition (`+`) and relational less than (`<`) (amongst other operations).

[[syntax-ops-unary]]
=== Unary operators

|===
| `<unop>`| Category   |

| `-`  |  A | numeric negation
| `+`  |  A | numeric identity
| `^`  |  B | bitwise negation
|===


[[syntax-ops-rel]]
=== Relational operators

|===
| `<relop>` | Category    |

| `‚ê£<‚ê£` | R | less than *(must be enclosed in whitespace)*
| `‚ê£>‚ê£` | R | greater than *(must be enclosed in whitespace)*
|  `==` | R | equals
|  `!=` | R | not equals
|  `\<=` | R | less than or equal
|  `>=` | R | greater than or equal
|===


Equality is structural.

[[syntax-ops-num]]
=== Numeric binary operators

|===
| `<binop>`| Category    |

|  `+` | A | addition
|  `-` | A | subtraction
|  `*` | A | multiplication
|  `/` | A | division
|  `%` | A | modulo
|  `**`| A | exponentiation
|===

[[syntax-ops-bitwise]]
=== Bitwise binary operators

|===
| `<binop>` | Category |

| `&`   | B | bitwise and
| `\|`   | B | bitwise or
| `^`   | B | exclusive or
| `<<`  | B | shift left
| `‚ê£>>` | B | shift right *(must be preceded by whitespace)*
| `+>>` | B | signed shift right
| `<<>` | B | rotate left
| `<>>` | B | rotate right
|===

[[syntax-ops-string]]
=== String operators

|===
|  `<binop>` | Category |

|  `#` | T | concatenation
|===

[[syntax-ops-assignment]]
=== Assignment operators

|===
|`:=`, `<unop>=`, `<binop>=`| Category|

| `:=`   | * | assignment (in place update)
| `+=`   | A | in place add
| `-=`   | A | in place subtract
| `*=`   | A | in place multiply
| `/=`   | A | in place divide
| `%=`   | A | in place modulo
| `**=`  | A | in place exponentiation
| `&=`   | B | in place logical and
| `\|=`   | B | in place logical or
| `^=`   | B | in place exclusive or
| `<\<=`  | B | in place shift left
| `>>=`  | B | in place shift right
| `+>>=` | B | in place signed shift right
| `<<>=` | B | in place rotate left
| `<>>=` | B | in place rotate right
| `#=`   | T | in place concatenation
|===

The  category of a compound assignment `<unop>=`/`<binop>=` is given by the category of the operator `<unop>`/`<binop>`.

[[syntax-precedence]]
=== Operator and keyword precedence

The following table defines the relative precedence and associativity of operators and tokens, ordered from lowest to highest precedence.
Tokens on the same line have equal precedence with the indicated associativity.

|===
|Precedence | Associativity | Token

| LOWEST  | none | `if _ _` (no `else`), `loop _` (no `while`)
|(higher)| none | `else`, `while`
|(higher)| right | `:=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`, `#=`, `&=`, `\|=`, `^=`, `<\<=`, `>>-`, `<<>=`, `<>>=`
|(higher)| left | `:`
|(higher)| left | `or`
|(higher)| left | `and`
|(higher)| none | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>`, `>=`
|(higher)| left | `+`, `-`, `#`
|(higher)| left | `*`, `/`, `%`
|(higher)| left | `\|`
|(higher)| left | `+&+`
|(higher)| left | `+^+`
|(higher)| none | `<<`, `>>`, `<<>`, `<>>`
| HIGHEST | left | `+**+`
|===

[[syntax-types]]
== Type syntax

Type expressions are used to specify the types of arguments, constraints (a.k.a bounds) on type parameters, definitions of type constructors, and the types of sub-expressions in type annotations.

```
<typ> ::=                                     type expressions
  <path> <typ-args>?                            constructor
  <sort>? { <typ-field>;* }                     object
  { <typ-tag>;* }                               variant
  { # }                                         empty variant
  [ var? <typ> ]                                array
  Null                                          null type
  ? <typ>                                       option
  <shared>? <typ-params>? <typ> -> <typ>        function
  async <typ>                                   future
  ( ((<id> :)? <typ>),* )                       tuple
  Any                                           top
  None                                          bottom
  Error                                         errors/exceptions
  ( type )                                      parenthesized type

<sort> ::= (actor | module | object)

<shared> ::=                                 shared function type qualifier
  shared query?

<path> ::=                                   paths
  <id>                                         type identifier
  <path> . <id>                                projection
```

An absent `<sort>?` abbreviates `object`.


[[primitive-types]]
=== Primitive types

{proglang} provides the following primitive type identifiers, including support for Booleans, signed and unsigned integers and machine words of various sizes, characters and text.

The category of a type determines the operators (unary, binary, relational and in-place update via assignment) applicable to values of that type.

|===
| Identifier | Category | Description

| `Bool` | L, R | Boolean values `true` and `false` and logical operators
| `Char` | R | Unicode characters
| `Text` | T, R | Unicode strings of characters with concatenation `_ # _` and iteration
| `Int`  | A, R | signed integer values with arithmetic (unbounded)
| `Int8`  | A, R | signed 8-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Int16`  | A, R | signed 16-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Int32`  | A, R | signed 32-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Int64`  | A, R | signed 64-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Nat`  | A, R | non-negative integer values with arithmetic (unbounded)
| `Nat8`  | A, R | non-negative 8-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Nat16`  | A, R | non-negative 16-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Nat32`  | A, R | non-negative 32-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Nat64`  | A, R | non-negative 64-bit integer values with checked arithmetic
| `Word8` | A, B, R | unsigned 8-bit integers with bitwise operations
| `Word16` | A, B, R | unsigned 16-bit integers with bitwise operations
| `Word32` | A, B, R | unsigned 32-bit integers with bitwise operations
| `Word64` | A, B, R | unsigned 64-bit integers with bitwise operations
| `Blob` | R | binary blobs with iterators
| `Principal` | R | principals
| `Error` | | (opaque) error values
|===

[[type-bool]]
=== Type `Bool`

The type `Bool` of categories L, R (Logical, Relational) has values `true` and `false` and is supported by one and two branch `if _ <exp> (else <exp>)?`, `not <exp>`, `_ and _` and `_ or _` expressions. Expressions `if`,  `and` and `or` are short-circuiting.

// Comparison TODO.

[[type-char]]
=== Type `Char`

A `Char` of category R (Relational) represents characters as a code point in the Unicode character
set. Characters can be converted to `Word32`, and `Word32`s in the
range *0 .. 0x1FFFFF* can be converted to `Char` (the conversion traps
if outside of this range). With `charToText` a character can be
converted into a text of length 1.

[[type-text]]
=== Type `Text`

The type `Text` of categories T and R (Text, Relational) represents sequences of Unicode characters (i.e. strings).
Function `t.len` returns the number of characters in `Text` value `t`.
Operations on text values include concatenation (`_ # _`) and sequential iteration over characters via `t.chars` as in `for (c : Char in t.chars()) { ... c ... }`.

// Comparison TODO.


[[types-int-and-nat]]
=== Types `Int` and `Nat`

The types `Int` and `Nat` are signed integral and natural numbers of categories A (Arithmetic) and R (Relational).

Both `Int` and `Nat` are arbitrary precision,
with only subtraction `-` on `Nat` trapping on underflow.

The subtype relation `Nat <: Int` holds, so every expression of type `Nat` is also an expression of type `Int` (but *not* vice versa).
In particular, every value of type `Nat` is also a value of type `Int`, without change of representation.

[[bounded-integers]]
=== Bounded integers `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32` and `Int64`

The types `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32` and `Int64` represent
signed integers with respectively 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit precision.
All have categories A (Arithmetic) and R (Relational).

Operations that may under- or overflow the representation are checked and trap on error.

[[bounded-naturals]]
=== Bounded naturals `Nat8`, `Nat16`, `Nat32` and `Nat64`

The types `Nat8`, `Nat16`, `Nat32` and `Nat64` represent
unsigned integers with respectively 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit precision.
All have categories A (Arithmetic) and R (Relational).

Operations that may under- or overflow the representation are checked and trap on error.

[[word-types]]
=== Word types

The types `Word8`, `Word16`, `Word32` and `Word64` represent
fixed-width bit patterns of width *n* (8, 16, 32 and 64).
All word types have categories A (Arithmetic), B (Bitwise) and  R (Relational).
As arithmetic types, word types implementing numeric wrap-around
(modulo *2^n*).
As bitwise types, word types support bitwise operations *and* `(&)`,
*or* `(|)` and *exclusive-or* `(^)`. Further, words can be rotated
left `(<<>)`, right `(<>>)`, and shifted left `(<<)`, right `(>>)`,
as well as right with two's-complement sign preserved `(+>>)`.
All shift and rotate amounts are considered modulo the word's width
*n*.

Conversions to `Int` and `Nat`, named `word`*n*`ToInt` and
`word`*n*`ToNat`, are exact and expose the word's bit-pattern as
two's complement values, resp. natural numbers. Reverse conversions,
named `intToWord`*n* and `natToWord`*n* are potentially lossy, but the
round-trip property holds modulo *2^n*. The former choose the
two's-complement representation for negative integers.

Word types are not in subtype relationship with each other or with
other arithmetic types, and their literals need type annotation, e.g.
`(-42 : Word16)`. For negative literals the two's-complement
representation is applied.

[[type-Blob]]
=== Type `Blob`

The type `Blob` of category R (Relational) represents binary blobs or sequences of bytes.
Function `b.size` returns the number of characters in `Blob` value `b`.
Operations on blob values include sequential iteration over bytes via function `b.bytes` as in
`for (w : Word8 in b.bytes()) { ... w ... }`.

[[type-Principal]]
=== Type `Principal`

The type `Principal` of category R (Relational) represents opaque
principals such as canisters and users that can, for example, be used to identify callers of
shared functions and used for simple authentication. Although opaque, principals may be converted to binary `Blob` values for more efficient hashing and other applications (see module `Principal` from the base library).

[[type-Error]]
=== Error type

Errors are opaque values constructed using operation
* `error: Text -> Error`
and examined using operations:
* `errorCode`: `Error -> ErrorCode`
* `errorMessage`: `Error -> Text`

(where `ErrorCode` is the prelude defined variant type:

```
type ErrorCode = {#error; #system ; /*...*/ };
```
)

`Error` values can be thrown and caught within an `async` expression or `shared` function (only).

A constructed error `e = error(m)` has `errorCode(e) = #error` and `errorMessage(e)=m`.
Errors with non-`#error` (system) error codes may be caught and thrown, but not constructed.

Note: Exiting an async block or shared function with a system error
exits with a copy of the error with revised code `#error` and the original error message.
This prevents programmatic forgery of system errors.

// TBR

[[constructed-types]]
=== Constructed types

`<path> <typ-args>?` is the application of a type identifier or path, either built-in (i.e. `Int`) or user defined, to zero or more type *arguments*.
The type arguments must satisfy the bounds, if any, expected by the type constructor's type parameters (see <<wf-types>>).

Though typically a type identifier, more generally,
`<path>` may be a `.`-separated sequence of actor, object or module identifiers ending in an identifier accessing a type component
of a value (for example, `Acme.Collections.List`).

[[object-types]]
=== Object types

`<sort>? { <typ-field>;* }` specifies an object type by listing its zero or more named *type fields*.

Within an object type, the names of fields must be distinct (both by name and hash value).

Object types that differ only in the ordering of the fields are equivalent.

When `<sort>?` is `actor`, all fields have `shared` function type (specifying messages).

[[variant-types]]
=== Variant types

`{ <typ-tag>;* }` specifies a variant type by listing its variant type fields as a sequence of `<typ-tag>`s.

Within a variant type, the tags of its variants must be distinct (both by name and hash value).

Variant types that differ only in the ordering of their variant type fields are equivalent.

`{ # }` specifies the empty variant type.

[[array-types]]
=== Array types

`[ var? <typ> ]` specifies the type of arrays with elements of type `<typ>`.

Arrays are immutable unless specified with qualifier `var`.

[[null-type]]
=== Null type

The `Null` type has a single value, the literal `null`. `Null` is a subtype of the option `? T`, for any type `T`.

[[option-types]]
=== Option types

`? <typ>` specifies the type of values that are either `null` or a proper value of the form `? <v>` where `<v>` has type `typ`.

[[function-types]]
=== Function types

Type `<shared>? <typ-params>? <typ1> -> <typ2>` specifies the type of functions that consume (optional) type parameters `<typ-params>`, consume a value parameter of type `<typ1>` and produce a result of type `<typ2>`.

Both `<typ1>` and `<typ2>` may reference type parameters declared in `<typ-params>`.

If `<typ1>` or `<typ2>` (or both) is a tuple type, then the length of that tuple type determines the argument or result arity of the function type.

The optional `<shared>` qualifier specifies whether the function value is shared, which further constrains the form of `<typ-params>`, `<typ1>` and `<typ2>` (see <<sharability>> below).

(Note that a `<shared>` function may itself be `shared` or `shared query`, determining the persistence of its state changes.)

[[async-types]]
=== Async types

`async <typ>` specifies a promise producing a value of a type `<typ>`.

Promise types typically appear as the result type of a `shared` function that produces an `await`-able value.

[[tuple-types]]
=== Tuple types

`( ((<id> :)? <typ>),* )` specifies the type of a tuple with zero or more ordered components.

The optional identifier `<id>`, naming its components, is for documentation purposes only and cannot be used for component access. In particular, tuple types that differ only in the names of components are equivalent.

The empty tuple type `()` is called the *unit type*.

[[any-type]]
=== Any type

Type `Any` is the *top* type, i.e. the super-type of all types. All values have type `Any`.

[[none-type]]
=== None type

Type `None` is the *bottom* type, a subtype of all other types.
No value has type `None`.

As an empty type, `None` can be used to specify the impossible return value of an infinite loop or unconditional trap.

[[paren-type]]
=== Parenthesised type

A function that takes an immediate, syntactic tuple of length *n >= 0* as its domain or range is a function that takes (respectively returns) *n* values.

When enclosing the argument or result type of a function, which is itself a tuple type,  `( <tuple-typ> )` declares that the function takes or returns a single (boxed) value of type `<tuple-type>`.

In all other positions, `( <typ> )` has the same meaning as `<typ>`.

[[type-fields]]
=== Type fields

```bnf
<typ-field> ::=                               object type fields
  <id> : <typ>                                  immutable
  var <id> : <typ>                              mutable
  <id> <typ-params>? <typ1> : <typ2>            function (short-hand)
```

A type field specifies the name and type of a field of an object.
The field names within a single object type must be distinct and have non-colliding hashes.

`<id> : <typ>` specifies an *immutable* field, named `<id>` of type `<typ>`.

`var <id> : <typ>` specifies a *mutable* field, named `<id>` of type `<typ>`.

[[type-tags]]
=== Variant type fields

```bnf
<typ-tag> ::=                                 variant type fields
  # <id> : <typ>                                tag
  # <id>                                        unit tag (short-hand)
```

A variant type field specifies the tag and type of a single variant of an enclosing variant type.
The tags within a single variant type must be distinct and have non-colliding hashes.

`# <id> : <typ>` specifies an (immutable) field, named `<id>` of type `<typ>`.
`# <id>` is sugar for an (immutable) field, named `<id>` of type `()`.

[[type-sugar]]
=== Sugar

When enclosed by an `actor` object type, `<id> <typ-params>? <typ1> : <typ2>` is syntactic sugar for an immutable field named `<id>` of `shared` function type
`shared <typ-params>? <typ1> -> <typ2>`.

When enclosed by a non-`actor` object type, `<id> <typ-params>? <typ1> : <typ2>` is syntactic sugar for an immutable field named `<id>` of ordinary function type `<typ-params>? <typ1> -> <typ2>`.

[[type-params]]
=== Type parameters

```bnf
<typ-params> ::=                              type parameters
  < typ-param,* >
<typ-param>
  <id> <: <typ>                               constrained type parameter
  <id>                                        unconstrained type parameter
```

A type constructors, function value or function type may be parameterised by a vector of comma-separated, optionally constrained, type parameters.

`<id> <: <typ>` declares a type parameter with constraint `<typ>`.
Any instantiation of `<id>` must subtype `<typ>` (at that same instantiation).

Syntactic sugar `<id>` declares a type parameter with implicit, trivial constraint `Any`.

The names of type parameters in a vector must be distinct.

All type parameters declared in a vector are in scope within its bounds.

[[type-args]]
=== Type arguments

```bnf
<typ-args> ::=                                type arguments
  < <typ>,* >
```
Type constructors and functions may take type arguments.

The number of type arguments must agree with the number of declared type parameters of the type constructor.

For a function, the number of type arguments, when provided,
must agree with the number of declared type parameters of the function's type.
Note that type arguments in function applications can typically be omitted and inferred by the compiler.

Given a vector of type arguments instantiating a vector of type parameters,
each type argument must satisfy the instantiated bounds of the corresponding
type parameter.

[[wf-types]]
=== Well-formed types

A type `T` is well-formed only if (recursively) its constituent types are well-formed, and:

* if `T` is `async U` then `U` is shared, and
* if `T` is `shared query? U -> V`, `U` is shared and
  `V == ()` or `V == async W'` with `W` shared, and
* if `T` is `C<T0, ..., TN>` where:
** a declaration `type C<X0 <: U0, Xn <: Un>  = ...` is in scope, and
** `Ti <: Ui[ T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn ]`, for each `0 \<= i \<= n`.
* if `T` is `actor { ... }` then all fields in `...` are immutable and have `shared` function type.

[[subtyping]]
=== Subtyping

Two types `T`, `U` are related by subtyping, written `T <: U`, whenever, one of the following conditions is true:

* `T` equals `U` (reflexivity).

* `U` equals `Any`.

* `T` equals `None`.

* `T` is a type parameter `X` declared with constraint `U`.

* `T` is `Nat` and `U` is `Int`.

* `T` is a tuple `(T0, ..., Tn)`, `U` is a tuple `(U0, ..., Un)`,
    and for each `0 \<= i \<= n`, `Ti <: Ui`.

* `T` is an immutable array type `[ V ]`, `U` is an immutable array type  `[ W ]`
    and `V <: W`.

* `T` is a mutable array type `[ var V ]`, `U` is a mutable array type  `[ var W ]`
    and `V == W`.

* `T` is `Null` and `U` is an option type `? W` for some `W`.

* `T` is `? V`, `U` is `? W` and `V <: W`.

* `T` is a promise `async V`, `U` is a promise `async W`,
    and `V <: W`.

* `T` is an object type `sort0 { fts0 }`,
  `U` is an object type `sort1 { fts1 }` and
** `sort0` == `sort1`, and, for all fields,
** if field `id : V` is in `fts0` then `id : W` is in `fts1` and `V <: W`, and
** if mutable field `var id : V` is in `fts0` then  `var id : W` is in `fts1` and `V == W`.
+
(That is, object type `T` is a subtype of object type `U` if they have same sort, every mutable field in `U` super-types the same field in `T` and every mutable field in `U` is mutable in `T` with an equivalent type. In particular, `T` may specify more fields than `U`.)
+
* `T` is a variant type `{ fts0 }`,
  `U` is a variant type `{ fts1 }` and
** if field `# id : V` is in `fts0` then `# id : W` is in `fts1` and `V <: W`.
+
(That is, variant type `T` is a subtype of variant type `U` if every field of `T` subtypes the same field of `U`. In particular, `T` may specify fewer variants than `U`.)
+
* `T` is a function type `<shared>? <X0 <: V0, ..., Xn <: Vn> T1 -> T2`,
  `U` is a function type `<shared>? <X0 <: W0, ..., Xn <: Wn> U1 -> U2` and
** `T` and `U` are either both equivalently `<shared>?`, and
** assuming constraints `X0 <: W0, ..., Xn <: Wn` then
*** for all `i`, `Wi <: Vi`, and
*** `U1 <: T1`, and
*** `T2 <: U2`.
+
(That is, function type `T` is a subtype of function type `U` if they have same `<shared>?` qualification, they have the same type parameters (modulo renaming) and assuming the bounds in `U`,
 every bound in `T` supertypes the corresponding parameter bound in `U` (contra-variance), the domain of `T` supertypes the domain of `U` (contra-variance) and the range of `T` subtypes
 the range of `U` (co-variance).)
+
* `T` (respectively `U`) is a constructed type `C<V0,...VN>` that is equal, by definition of type constructor `C`,  to `W`, and `W <: U` (respectively `U <: W`).

* For some type `V`, `T <: V` and `V <: U` (_transitivity_).

[[sharability]]
=== Sharability

A type `T` is _shared_ if it is

* `Any` or `None`, or
* a primitive type other than `Error`, or
* an option type `? V` where `V` is shared, or
* a tuple type `(T0, ..., Tn)` where all `Ti` are shared, or
* an immutable array type `[V]` where `V` is shared, or
* an `object` type where all fields are immutable and have shared type, or
* a variant type where all tags have shared type, or
* a shared function type, or
* an `actor` type.

[[semantics]]
== Static and dynamic semantics

Below, we give a detailed account of the semantics of {proglang}
programs.

For each <<syntax-expressions, expression form>>
and each <<syntax-decls, declaration form>>, we summarize its
semantics, both in static terms (based on typing) and dynamic terms
(based on program evaluation).

[[prog]]
=== Programs

A program `<prog>` is a sequence of declarations `<dec>;*` that ends with an optional actor declaration. The actor declaration determines the main actor, if any, of the program.

All type and value declarations within `<prog>` are mutually-recursive.

[[decl-field]]
=== Declaration fields

Declaration fields declare the fields of actors and objects.
They are just declarations, prefixed by an optional visibility qualifier `public` or  `private`; if omitted, visibility defaults to `private`.

Any identifier bound by a `public` declaration appears in the type of enclosing object and is accessible via the dot notation.

An identifier bound by a `private` declaration is excluded form the type of the enclosing object and inaccessible via the dot notation.


[[decl-seq]]
=== Sequence of declarations

A sequence of declarations `<dec>;*` occurring in a block, a program or the `exp-field;*` sequence of an object declaration has type `T`
provided:

* `<dec>;*` is empty and `T == ()`; or
* `<dec>;*` is non-empty and:
  * all value identifiers bound by `<dec>;*` are distinct, and
  * all type identifiers bound by `<dec>;*` are distinct, and
  * under the assumption that each value identifier `<id>` in `decs;*` has type `var_id? Tid`,
    and assuming the type definitions in `decs;*`:
    * each declaration in `<dec>;*` is well-typed, and
    * each value identifier `<id>` in bindings produced by `<dec>;*` has type `var_id? Tid`, and
    * all but the last `<dec>` in `<dec>;*` of the form `<exp>` has type `()`;
    * the last declaration in `<dec>;*` has type `T`.

Declarations in `<dec>;*` are evaluated sequentially. The first declaration that traps causes the entire sequence to trap.
Otherwise, the result of the declaration is the value of the last declaration in `<dec>;*`. In addition, the set of value bindings defined by  `<dec>;*` is
the union of the bindings introduced by each declaration in `<dec>;*`.

It is a compile-time error if any declaration in `<dec>;*` might require the value of an identifier declared in `<dec>;*`
before that identifier's declaration has been evaluated. Such *use-before-define* errors are detected by a simple,
conservative static analysis not described here.

[[patterns]]
=== Patterns

Patterns bind function parameters, declare identifiers and decompose values into their constituent parts in the cases of a `switch` expression.

Matching a pattern against a value may _succeed_, _binding_ the corresponding identifiers in the pattern to their matching values, or _fail_. Thus the result of a match is either a
successful binding, mapping identifiers of the pattern to values, or failure.

The consequences of pattern match failure depends on the context of the pattern.

* In a function application or `let`-binding, failure to match the formal argument pattern or `let`-pattern causes a *trap*.
* In a `case` branch of a `switch` expression, failure to match that case's pattern continues with an attempt to match the next case of the switch, trapping only when no such case remains.

[[pat-wildcard]]
=== Wildcard pattern

The wildcard pattern `_`  matches a single value without binding its contents to an identifier.

[[pat-id]]
=== Identifier pattern

The identifier pattern `<id>` matches a single value and binds it to the identifier `<id>`.

[[pat-lit]]
=== Literal pattern

The literal pattern `<unop>? <lit>` matches a single value against the constant value of literal `<lit>` and fails if they are not (structurally) equal values.

For integer literals only, the optional `<unop>` determines the sign of the value to match.

[[pat-tuple]]
=== Tuple pattern

The tuple pattern `( <pat>,* )` matches a n-tuple value against an n-tuple of patterns (both the tuple and pattern must have the same number of items).
The set of identifiers bound by each component of the tuple pattern must be distinct.

The empty tuple pattern `()` is called the *unit pattern*.

Pattern matching fails if one of the patterns fails to match the corresponding item of the tuple value.
Pattern matching succeeds if every pattern matches the corresponding component of the tuple value.
The binding returned by a successful match is the disjoint union of the bindings returned by the component matches.

[[pat-object]]
=== Object pattern

The object pattern `{ <pat-field>;* }` matches an object value, a collection of named field values, against a sequence of named pattern fields.
The set of identifiers bound by each field of the object pattern must be distinct.
The names of the pattern fields in the object pattern must be distinct.

Pattern matching fails if one of the pattern fields fails to match the corresponding field value of the object value.
Pattern matching succeeds if every pattern field matches the corresponding named field of the object value.
The binding returned by a successful match is the union of the bindings returned by the field matches.

The `<sort>` of the matched object type must be determined by an enclosing type annotation or other contextual type information.

[[pat-variant]]
=== Variant pattern

The variant pattern `# <id> <pat>?` matches a variant value (of the form `# <id'> v`) against a variant pattern. An absent `<pat>?` is shorthand for the unit pattern (`()`).
Pattern matching fails if the tag `<id'>` of the value is distinct from the `<id>` of the pattern (i.e. `<id>` <> `<id'>`); or the tags are equal but the value `v` does not match the pattern `<pat>?`.
Pattern matching succeeds if the tag of the value is `<id>` (i.e. `<id'>` = `<id>`) and the value `v` matches the pattern `<pat>?`.
The binding returned by a successful match is just the binding returned by the match of `v` against `<pat>?`.

[[pat-anno]]
=== Annotated pattern

The annotated pattern `<pat> : <typ>` matches value of `v` type `<typ>` against the pattern `<pat>`.

`<pat> : <typ>` is *not* a dynamic type test, but is used to constrain the types of identifiers bound in `<pat>`, e.g. in the argument pattern to a function.

[[pat-option]]
=== Option pattern

The option `? <pat>` matches a value of option type `? <typ>`.

The match *fails* if the value is `null`. If the value is `? v`, for some value `v`, then the result of matching `? <pat>` is the result of matching `v` against `<pat>`.

Conversely, the `null` literal pattern may be used to test whether a value of option type is the value `null` and not `? v` for some `v`.

[[pat-or]]
=== Or pattern

The or pattern `<pat1> or <pat2>` is a disjunctive pattern.

The result of matching `<pat1> or <pat2>` against a value is the result of
matching `<pat1>`, if it succeeds, or the result of matching `<pat2>`, if the first match fails.

(Note, statically, neither `<pat1>` nor `<pat2>` may contain identifier (`<id>`) patterns so a successful match always binds zero identifiers.)



[[decl-exp]]
=== Expression declaration

The declaration `<exp>` has type `T` provided the expression `<exp>` has type `T` . It declares no bindings.

The declaration `<exp>` evaluates to the result of evaluating `<exp>` (typically for `<exp>`'s side-effect).

Note that if `<exp>` appears within a sequence of declarations, but not as the last declaration of that sequence, then `T` must be `()`.



// TBR

[[decl-ignore]]
=== Ignore declaration

The declaration `ignore <exp>` has type `()` provided the expression `<exp>` has type `Any` . It declares no bindings.

The declaration `ignore <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` (typically for `<exp>`'s side-effect) but discards its value.

The semantics is equivalent to `let _ = <exp> : Any`.

`Ignore` is useful for evaluating an expression within a sequence of declarations
when that expression has non-`unit` type (and the simpler `<exp>` declaration would be ill-typed).

[[decl-let]]
=== Let declaration

The let declaration `let <pat> = <exp>` has type `T` and declares the bindings in `<pat>` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `T`.
* `<pat>` has type `T`.

The declaration `let <pat> = <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, the declaration evaluates to `trap`. If `r` is a value `v` then evaluation proceeds by
matching the value `v` against `<pat>`. If matching fails, then the result is `trap`. Otherwise, the result is `v` and the binding of all identifiers in `<pat>` to their matching values in `v`.

All bindings declared by a `let` (if any) are *immutable*.

[[decl-var]]
=== Var declaration

The variable declaration `var <id> (: <typ>)? = <exp>` declares a *mutable* variable `<id>` with initial value `<exp>`. The variable's value can be updated by assignment.

The declaration `var <id>` has type `()` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `T`; and
* If the annotation `(:<typ>)?` is present, then `T == <typ>`.

Within the scope of the declaration, `<id>` has type `var T` (see <<exp-assn>>).

Evaluation of `var <id> (: <typ>)? = <exp>` proceeds by evaluating `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, the declaration evaluates to `trap`. Otherwise, the
`r` is some value `v` that determines the initial value of mutable variable `<id>`.
The result of the declaration is `()` and
`<id>` is bound to a fresh location that contains `v`.

[[decl-type]]
=== Type declaration

The declaration `type <id> <typ-params>? = <typ>` declares a new type constructor `<id>`, with optional type parameters `<typ-params>` and definition `<typ>`.

The declaration `type C < X0<:T0>, ..., Xn <: Tn > = U` is well-formed provided:

* type parameters `X0`, ..., `Xn` are distinct, and
* assuming the constraints `X0 <: T0`, ..., `Xn <: Tn`:
  * constraints `T0`, ..., `Tn` are well-formed.
  * definition `U` is well-formed.

In scope of the declaration  `type C < X0<:T0>, ..., Xn <: Tn > = U`, any  well-formed type `C < U0, ..., Un>` is equivalent to its expansion
`U [ U0/X0, ..., Un/Xn ]`.  Distinct type expressions that expand to identical types are inter-changeable, regardless of any distinction between type constructor names. In short, the equivalence between types is structural, not nominal.

[[decl-obj]]
=== Object declaration

Declaration `<sort> <id>? =? { <exp-field>;* }` declares an object with optional identifier `<id>` and zero or more fields `<exp_field>;*`.
Fields can be declared with `public` or `private` visibility; if the visibility is omitted, it defaults to `private`.

The qualifier `<sort>` (one of `actor`, `module` or `object`) specifies the *sort* of the object's type. The sort imposes restrictions on the types of the public object fields.

Let `T = sort { [var0] id0 : T0, ... , [varn] idn : T0 }` denote the type of the object.
Let `<dec>;*` be the sequence of declarations in `<exp_field>;*`.
The object declaration has type `T` provided that:

1. type `T` is well-formed for sort `sort`, and
2. under the assumption that `<id> : T`,
   * the sequence of declarations `<dec>;*` has type `Any` and declares the disjoint sets of private and public identifiers, `Id_private` and `Id_public` respectively,
     with types `T(id)` for `id` in `Id == Id_private union Id_public`, and
   * `{ id0, ..., idn } == Id_public`, and
   * for all `i in 0 \<= i \<= n`, `[vari] Ti == T(idi)`.

Note that requirement 1. imposes further constraints on the field types of `T`.
In particular:

* if the sort is `actor` then all public fields must be non-`var` (immutable)     `shared` functions (the public interface of an actor can only provide asynchronous messaging via shared functions).

Evaluation of `(object|actor)? <id>? =? { <exp-field>;* }` proceeds by
evaluating the declarations in `<dec>;*`. If the evaluation of `<dec>;*` traps, so does the object declaration.
Otherwise, `<dec>;*` produces a set of bindings for identifiers in `Id`.
let `v0`, ..., `vn` be the values or locations bound to identifiers `<id0>`, ..., `<idn>`.
The result of the object declaration is the object `v == sort { <id0> = v1, ..., <idn> = vn}`.

If `<id>?` is present, the declaration binds `<id>` to `v`. Otherwise, it produces the empty set of bindings.

// TBR do we actually propagate trapping of actor creation?

[[decl-func]]
=== Function declaration

The function declaration  `<shared-pat>? func <id>? <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>` is syntactic sugar for
a named `let` or anonymous declaration of a function expression. That is:

```bnf
<shared-pat>? func <id>? <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp> :=
  let <id> = <shared-pat>? func <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>    (when <id>? present)

  <shared-pat>? func <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>               (when <id>? absent)  
```


Named function definitions are recursive.

[[decl-class]]
=== Class declaration

The declaration `<sort>? class <id> <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <id_this>? { <exp-field>;* }` is sugar for pair of a type and function declaration:

```bnf
<sort>? class <id> <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <id_this>? { <dec-field>;* } :=
  type <id> <typ-params> = <sort> { <typ-field>;* };
  func <id> <typ-params>? <pat> : <id> <typ-args>  = <sort> <id_this>? { <dec-field>;* }
```

where:

* `<typ-args>?` is the sequence of type identifiers bound by `<typ-params>?` (if any), and
* `<typ-field>;*` is the set of public field types inferred from `<dec-field;*>`.
* `<id_this>?` is the optional `this` parameter of the object instance.

[[eval-identifiers]]
=== Identifiers

The expression `<id>` evaluates to the value bound to `<id>` in the current evaluation environment.

[[eval-literals]]
=== Literals

A literal has type `T` only when its value is within the prescribed range of values of type `T`.

The literal (or constant) expression `<lit>` evaluates to itself.

[[unary-operators]]
=== Unary operators

The unary operator `<unop> <exp>` has type `T` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `T`, and
* The category of `<unop>` is a category of `T`.

The unary operator expression `<unop> <exp>` evaluates `exp` to a result. If the result is a value `v`, it returns the result of `<unop> v`.
If the result is `trap`, the entire expression results in `trap`.

[[binary-operators]]
=== Binary operators

The binary compound assignment `<exp1> <binop> <exp2>` has type `T` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `T`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `T`, and
* The category of `<binop>` is a category of `T`.

The binary operator expression `<exp1> <binop> <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `r1`  and `r2` are values `v1` and `v2` and the expression returns
the result of `v1 <binop> v2`.

[[relational-operators]]
=== Relational operators

The relational expression `<exp1> <relop> <exp2>` has type `Bool` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `T`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `T`, and
* the category R is a category of `T`.

The binary operator expression `<exp1> <relop> <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `r1`  and `r2` are values `v1` and `v2` and the expression returns
the Boolean result of `v1 <relop> v2`.

[[exp-tuple]]
=== Tuples

Tuple expression `(<exp1>, ..., <expn>)` has tuple type `(T1, ..., Tn)`, provided
`<exp1>`, ..., `<expN>` have types `T1`, ..., `Tn`.

The tuple expression `(<exp1>, ..., <expn>)` evaluates the expressions `exp1` ... `expn` in order, trapping as soon as some expression `<expi>` traps. If no evaluation traps and `exp1`, ..., `<expn>` evaluate to values `v1`,...,`vn` then the tuple expression returns the tuple value `(v1, ... , vn)`.

The tuple projection `<exp> . <nat>` has type `Ti` provided `<exp>` has tuple type
`(T1, ..., Ti, ..., Tn)`, `<nat>` == `i` and `1 \<= i \<= n`.

The projection `<exp> . <nat>` evaluates `exp` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, then  the result is `trap`. Otherwise, `r` must be a tuple  `(v1,...,vi,...,vn)` and the result of the projection is the value `vi`.

The empty tuple expression `()` is called the *unit value*.

[[exp-option]]
=== Option expressions

The option expression `? <exp>` has type `? T` provided `<exp>` has type `T`.

The literal `null` has type `Null`. Since `Null <: ? T` for any `T`, literal `null` also has type `? T` and signifies the "missing" value at type `? T`.

[[exp-variant]]
=== Variant injection

The variant injection `# <id> <exp>` has variant type `{# id T}` provided:
* `<exp>` has type `T`.

The variant injection `# <id>` is just syntactic sugar for `# <id> ()`.

The variant injection`# <id> <exp>` evaluates `exp` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, then the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, `r` must be a value `v` and the result of the injection is the tagged value `# <id> v`.

The tag and contents of a variant value can be tested and accessed using a <<pat-variant,variant pattern>>.

[[exp-object]]
=== Objects

Objects can be written in literal form `{ <exp-field>;* }`, consisting of a list of expression fields:

```bnf
<exp-field> ::= var? <id> = <exp>
```
Such an object literal is equivalent to the object declaration `object { <dec-field>;* }` where the declaration fields are obtained from the expression fields by prefixing each of them with `public let`, or just `public` in case of `var` fields.

[[exp-proj]]
=== Object projection (member access)

The object projection `<exp> . <id>` has type `var? T` provided `<exp>` has object type
`sort { var1? <id1> : T1, ..., var? <id> : T, ..., var? <idn> : Tn }` for some sort `sort`.

The object projection `<exp> . <id>` evaluates `exp` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, then the result is `trap`. Otherwise, `r` must be an
object value  `{ <id1> = v1,..., id = v, ..., <idn> = vn }` and the result of the projection is the value `v` of field `id`.

If `var` is absent from `var? T` then the value `v` is the constant value of immutable field `<id>`, otherwise:

* if the projection occurs as the target an assignment statement;
  `v` is the mutable location of the field `<id>`.
* otherwise,
  `v` (of type `T`) is the value currently stored in mutable field `<id>`.

[[exp-dot]]

=== Special member access

The iterator access `<exp> . <id>` has type `T` provided `<exp>` has type
`U`, and `U`,`<id>` and `T` are related by a row of the following table:

|===
| U | <id> | T  | Description
| `Text` | `len` | `Nat` | length in characters
| `Text` | `chars` | `{ next: () -> Char? }` | character iterator, first to last
| | | |
| `Blob` | `size` | `Nat` | size in bytes
| `Blob` | `bytes` | `{ next: () -> Word8? }` | byte iterator, first to last
| | | |
| `[var? T]` | `get` | `Nat -> T` | indexed read function
| `[var? T]` | `keys` | `{ next: () -> Nat? }` | index iterator, by ascending index
| `[var? T]` | `vals` | `{ next: () -> T? }` | value iterator, by ascending index
| `[var T]` | `set` | `(Nat, T) -> ()` | indexed write function (mutable arrays only)
|===

The projection `<exp> . <id>` evaluates `exp` to a result `r`.
If `r` is `trap`, then the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, `r` must be a value of type `U` and the result of the projection is a value of type `T`
whose semantics is given by the Description column of the previous table.

Note: the `chars`, `bytes`, `keys` and `vals` members
produce stateful *iterator objects* than can be
consumed by `for` expressions (see <<exp-for>>).

[[exp-assn]]
=== Assignment

The assignment `<exp1> := <exp2>` has type `()` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `var T`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `T`.

The assignment expression `<exp1> := <exp2>` evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise `r1`  and `r2` are (respectively) a location `v1` (a mutable identifier, an item of a mutable array or a mutable field of object) and a value `v2`. The expression updates the current value stored in `v1` with the new value `v2` and returns the empty tuple `()`.

[[exp-uassn]]
=== Unary compound assignment

The unary compound assignment `<unop>= <exp>` has type `()` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `var T`, and
* `<unop>`'s category is a category of `T`.

The unary compound assignment
`<unop>= <exp>`  evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap` the evaluation traps, otherwise `r` is a location storing value `v` and `r` is updated to
contain the value `<unop> v`.

[[exp-bassn]]
=== Binary compound assignment

The binary compound assignment `<exp1> <binop>= <exp2>` has type `()` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `var T`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `T`, and
* `<binop>`'s category is a category of `T`.

For binary operator `<binop>`, `<exp1> <binop>= <exp1>`,
the compound assignment expression `<exp1> <binop>= <exp2>` evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.
Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise `r1`  and `r2` are (respectively) a location `v1` (a mutable identifier, an item of a mutable array or a mutable field of object) and a value `v2`. The expression updates the current value, `w` stored in `v1` with the new value `w <binop> v2` and returns the empty tuple `()`.

[[exp-arrays]]
=== Arrays

The expression `[ var? <exp>,* ]` has type `[var? T]` provided
each expression `<exp>` in the sequence `<exp,>*` has type T.

The array expression `[ var <exp0>, ..., <expn> ]` evaluates the expressions `exp0` ... `expn` in order, trapping as soon as some expression `<expi>` traps. If no evaluation traps and `exp0`, ..., `<expn>` evaluate to values `v0`,...,`vn` then the array expression returns the array value `[var? v0, ... , vn]` (of size `n+1`).

The array indexing expression `<exp1> [ <exp2> ]` has type `var? T` provided <exp> has (mutable or immutable) array type `[var? T1]`.

The projection `<exp1> . <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, then the result is `trap`.

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `r1` is an array value, `var? [v0, ..., vn]`, and `r2` is a natural integer `i`. If  `i > n` the index expression returns `trap`.

Otherwise, the index expression returns the value `v`, obtained as follows:

If `var` is absent from `var? T` then the value `v` is the constant value `vi`.

Otherwise,

* if the projection occurs as the target an assignment statement
  then `v` is the `i`th location in the array;
* otherwise,
  `v` is `vi`, the value currently stored in the `i`th location of the array.

[[exp-call]]
=== Function calls

The function call expression `<exp1> <T0,...,Tn>? <exp2>` has type `T` provided:

* the function `<exp1>` has function type `<shared>? < X0 <: V0, ..., Xn <: Vn > U1-> U2`; and
* if `<T0,...,Tn>?` is absent but n > 0 then there exists minimal `T0, ..., Tn` (inferred by the compiler) such that:
* each type argument satisfies the corresponding type parameter's bounds:
  for each `1 \<= i \<= n`, `Ti <: [T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn]Vi`; and
* the argument `<exp2>` has type `[T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn]U1`, and
* `T == [T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn]U2`.

The call expression `<exp1> <T0,...,Tn>? <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, then the result is `trap`.

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `r1` is a function value, `<shared-pat>? func <X0 <: V0, ..., n <: Vn> <pat1> { <exp> }` (for some implicit environment), and `r2` is a value `v2`.
If `<shared-pat>` is present and of the form `shared query? <pat>` then evaluation continues by matching the record value `{caller = p}` against `<pat>`, where `p`
is the `Principal` invoking the function (typically a user or canister).
Matching continues by matching `v1` against `<pat1>`.
If pattern matching succeeds with some bindings, then evaluation returns the result of `exp` in the environment of the function value (not shown) extended with those bindings.
Otherwise, some pattern match has failed and the call results in `trap`.

Note: the exhaustiveness side condition on `shared` function expressions ensures that argument pattern matching cannot fail (see <<exp-func>>).

[[exp-func]]
=== Functions

The function expression `<shared-pat>? func < X0 <: T0, ..., Xn <: Tn > <pat1> (: U2)? =?  <exp>` has type `<shared>? < X0 <: T0, ..., Xn <: Tn > U1-> U2` if, under the
assumption that `X0 <: T0, ..., Xn <: Tn`:

* `<shared-pat>?` is of the form `shared query? <pat>` if and only if `<shared>?` is `shared query?`;
* all the types in `T0, ..., Tn` and `U2` are well-formed and well-constrained;
* pattern `<pat>` has *context type* `{ caller : Principal }`;
* pattern `<pat1>` has type `U1`;
* if the function is `shared` then `<pat>` and `<pat1>` must be exhaustive;
* expression `<exp>` has type return type `U2` under the assumption that `<pat1>` has type `U1`.

`<shared-pat>? func <typ-params>? <pat1> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>` evaluates to a function
value (a.k.a. closure), denoted `<shared-pat>? func <typ-params>? <pat1> = <exp>`, that stores the code of the function
together with the bindings from the current evaluation environment (not shown) needed to evaluate calls to the function value.

Note that a `<shared-pat>` function may itself be `shared <pat>` or `shared query <pat>`:

* A `shared <pat>` function may be invoked from a remote caller. Unless causing a trap, the effects on the callee persist beyond completion of the call.
* A `shared query <pat>` function may be also be invoked from a remote caller, but the effects on the callee are transient and discarded once the call has completed with a result (whether a value or error).

In either case, `<pat>` provides access to a context value identifying the *caller* of the shared (query) function.

Note: the context type is a record to allow extension with further fields in future releases.


[[exp-block]]
=== Blocks

The block expression `{ <dec>;* }` has type `T` provided the last declaration in the sequence `<dec>;*` has type `T`.
All identifiers declared in block must be distinct type identifiers or distinct value identifiers and are in scope in the definition of all other declarations in the block.

The bindings of identifiers declared in `{ dec;* }` are local to the block.
The type `T` must be well-formed in the enclosing environment of the block. In particular, any local, recursive types that cannot be expanded to types well-formed the enclosing environment must not appear in `T`.

The type system ensures that a value identifier cannot be evaluated before its declaration has been evaluated, precluding run-time errors at the cost of rejection some well-behaved programs.

Identifiers whose types cannot be inferred from their declaration, but are used in a forward reference, may require an additional type annotation (see <<pat-anno>>) to satisfy the type checker.

The block expression `{ <dec>;* }` evaluates each declaration in `<dec>;*` in sequence (program order). The first declaration in `<dec>;*` that results in a trap cause the block to result in `trap`, without evaluating subsequent declarations.

[[exp-not]]
=== Not

The not expression `not <exp>` has type `Bool` provided `<exp>` has type `Bool`.

If `<exp>` evaluates to `trap`, the expression returns `trap`.
Otherwise, `<exp>` evaluates to a Boolean value `v` and the expression returns `not v`, (the Boolean negation of `v`).

[[exp-and]]
=== And

The and expression `<exp1> and <exp2>` has type `Bool` provided `<exp1>` and `<exp2>` have type `Bool`.

The expression `<exp1> and <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`. Otherwise `r1` is a Boolean value `v`.
If `v == false` the expression returns the value `false` (without evaluating `<exp2>`).
Otherwise, the expression returns the result of evaluating `<exp2>`.

[[exp-or]]
=== Or

The or expression `<exp1> or <exp2>` has type `Bool` provided `<exp1>` and `<exp2>` have type `Bool`.

The expression `<exp1> and <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`. Otherwise `r1` is a Boolean value `v`.
If `v == true` the expression returns the value `true` (without evaluating `<exp2>`).
Otherwise, the expression returns the result of evaluating `<exp2>`.

[[exp-if]]
=== If

The expression `if <exp1> <exp2> (else <exp3>)?` has type `T` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `Bool`
* `<exp2>` has type `T`
* `<exp3>` is absent and `() <: T`, or
* `<exp3>` is present and has type `T`.

The expression evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`.
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is  `trap`.
Otherwise, `r1` is the value `true` or `false`.
If `r1` is `true`, the result is the result of evaluating `<exp2>`.
Otherwise, `r1` is `false` and the result is `()` (if `<exp3>` is absent) or the result of `<exp3>` (if `<exp3>` is present).

[[exp-switch]]
=== Switch

The switch expression
  `switch <exp0> { (case <pat> <exp>;)+ }`
has type `T` provided:

* `exp0` has type `U`; and
* for each case `case <pat> <exp>` in the sequence `(case <pat> <exp>;)+` :
  * pattern `<pat>` has type `U`; and,
  * expression `<exp>` has type `T`

The expression evaluates `<exp0>` to a result `r1`.
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, `r1` is some value `v`.
Let `case <pat> <exp>;` be the first case in `(case <pat> <exp>;)+` such that `<pat>` matches `v` for some binding of identifiers to values.
Then result of the `switch` is the result of evaluating `<exp>` under those bindings.
If no case has a pattern that matches `v`, the result of the switch is `trap`.

[[exp-while]]
=== While

The expression `while <exp1> <exp2>` has type `()` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `Bool`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `()`.

The expression evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`.
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, `r1` is the value `true` or `false`.
If `r1` is `true`, the result is the result of re-evaluating `while <exp1> <exp2>`.
Otherwise, the result is `()`.

[[exp-loop]]
=== Loop

The expression `loop <exp>` has type `None` provided `<exp>` has type `()`.

The expression evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r1`.
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, the result is the result of (re-)evaluating `loop <exp1>`.

[[exp-loop-while]]
=== Loop-while

The expression `loop <exp1> while <exp2>` has type `()` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `()`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `Bool`.

The expression evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`.
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, evaluation continues with `<exp2>`, producing result `r2`.
If `r2` is `trap` the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, if `r2` is `true`, the result is the result of re-evaluating `loop <exp1> while <exp2>`.
Otherwise, `r2` is false and the result is `()`.

[[exp-for]]
=== For

The iterator expression `for ( <pat> in <exp1> ) <exp2>` has type `()` provided:


* `<exp1>` has type `{ next : () -> ?T }`,
* pattern `<pat>` has type `T`, and
* expression `<exp2>` has type `()` (in the environment extended with the bindings of `<pat>`).

The `for`-expression is syntactic sugar for

```bnf
for ( <pat> in <exp1> ) <exp2> :=
  {
    let x = <exp1>;
    label l loop {
      switch (x.next()) {
        case (? <pat>) <exp2>;
        case (null) break l;
      }
    }
  }
```

where `x` is a fresh identifier.


In particular, the `for` loop will trap if evaluation of `<exp1>` traps; as soon as `x.next()` traps, or the value of `x.next()` does not match pattern `<pat>`, or when `<exp2>` traps.

Note: although general purpose, `for` loops are commonly used to consume iterators produced by <<exp-dot>> to, for example, loop over the indices (`a.keys()`) or values (`a.vals()`) of some array (here `a`).

[[exp-label]]
=== Label

The label-expression  `label <id> (: <typ>)? <exp>` has type `T` provided:

* `(: <typ>)?` is absent and `T` is unit; or `(: <typ>)?` is present and `T == <typ>`;
* `<exp>` has type `T` in the static environment extended with `label l : T`.

The result of evaluating `label <id> (: <typ>)? <exp>` is the result of evaluating `<exp>`.

[[exp-labeled-loops]]
=== Labeled loops

If `<exp>` in `label <id> (: <typ>)? <exp>` is a looping construct:

* `while (exp2) <exp1>`,
* `loop <exp1> (while (<exp2>))?`, or
* `for (<pat> in <exp2>) <exp1>`

the body, `<exp1>`, of the loop is implicitly enclosed in `label <id_continue> (...)` allowing early continuation of the loop by the evaluation of expression `continue <id>`.

`<id_continue>` is fresh identifier that can only be referenced by `continue <id>`
(through its implicit expansion to `break <id_continue>`).

[[exp-break]]
=== Break

The expression `break <id>` is equivalent to `break <id> ()`.

The expression `break <id> <exp>` has type `None` provided:

* The label `<id>` is declared with type `label <id> : T`.
* `<exp>` has type `T`.

The evaluation of `break <id> <exp>` evaluates exp to some result `r`.
If `r` is `trap`, the result is `trap`.
If `r` is a value `v`, the evaluation abandons the current computation up to dynamically enclosing declaration `label <id> ...` using the value `v` as the result of that labelled expression.

[[exp-continue]]
=== Continue

The expression `continue <id>` is equivalent to `break <id_continue>`, where
 `<id_continue>` is implicitly declared around the bodies of `<id>`-labelled looping constructs (see <<exp-labeled-loops>>).

[[exp-return]]
=== Return

The expression `return` is equivalent to `return ()`.

The expression `return <exp>` has type `None` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `T` and
  * `T` is the return type of the nearest enclosing function (with no intervening `async` expression), or
  * `async T` is the type of the nearest enclosing (perhaps implicit) `async` expression (with no intervening function declaration)

The `return` expression exits the corresponding dynamic function invocation or completes the corresponding dynamic async expression with the result of `exp`.

// TBR async traps?

[[exp-async]]
=== Async

The async expression `async <exp>` has type `async T` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `T`;
* `T` is shared.

Any control-flow label in scope for `async <exp>` is not in scope for `<exp>`. However,
`<exp>` may declare and use its own, local, labels.

The implicit return type in `<exp>` is `T`. That is, the return expression, `<exp0>`, (implicit or explicit) to any enclosed `return <exp0>?` expression, must have type `T`.

Evaluation of `async <exp>` queues a message to evaluate `<exp>` in the nearest enclosing or top-level actor. It immediately returns a promise of type `async T` that can be used to `await` the result of the pending evaluation of `<exp>`.

[[exp-await]]
=== Await

The `await` expression `await <exp>` has type `T` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `async T`,
* `T` is shared,
* the `await` is explicitly enclosed by an `async`-expression or appears in the body of a `shared` function.

Expression `await <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, evaluation returns `trap`. Otherwise `r` is a promise. If the promise is complete with value `v`, then `await <exp>` evaluates to value `v`.
If the promise is complete with (thrown) error value `e`, then `await <exp>` re-throws the error `e`.
If the `promise` is incomplete, that is, its evaluation is still pending, `await <exp>` suspends evaluation of the neared enclosing `async` or `shared`-function, adding the suspension to the wait-queue of the `promise`. Execution of the suspension is resumed once the promise is completed (if ever).

_WARNING:_ between suspension and resumption of a computation, the state of the enclosing actor may change due to concurrent processing of other incoming actor messages. It is the programmer's responsibility to guard against non-synchronized state changes.

[[exp-throw]]
=== Throw

The `throw` expression `throw <exp>` has type `None` provided:

* `<exp>` has type `Error`,
* the `throw` is explicitly enclosed by an `async`-expression or appears in the body of a `shared` function.

Expression `throw <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, evaluation returns `trap`. Otherwise `r` is an error value `e`. Execution proceeds from the `catch` clause of the nearest enclosing `try <exp> catch <pat> <ex>` whose pattern `<pat>` matches value `e`. If there is no such `try` expression, `e` is stored as the erroneous result of the `async` value of the nearest enclosing `async` expression or `shared` function invocation.

[[exp-try]]
=== Try

The `try` expression `try <exp1> catch <pat> <exp2>` has type `T` provided:

* `<exp1>` has type `T`,
* `<pat>` has type `Error` and `<exp2>` has type `T` in the context extended with `<pat>`, and
* the `try` is explicitly enclosed by an `async`-expression or appears in the body of a `shared` function.

Expression `try <exp1> catch <pat> <exp2>` evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r`.
If evaluation of  `<exp1>` throws an uncaught error value `e`, the result of the `try` is the result of evaluating `<exp2>` under the bindings determined by the match of `e` against `pat`.

Note: because the `Error` type is opaque, the pattern match cannot fail (typing ensures that `<pat>` is an irrefutable wildcard or identifier pattern).

See <<type-Error>>.

[[exp-assert]]
=== Assert

The assert expression `assert <exp>` has type `()` provided `exp` has type `Bool`.

Expression `assert <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap` evaluation returns `trap`. Otherwise `r` is a Boolean value `v`. The result of `assert <exp>` is:

* the value `()`, when `v` is `true`; or
* `trap`, when `v` is `false`.

[[exp-anno]]
=== Type annotation


The type annotation expression `<exp> : <typ>` has type `T` provided:

* `<typ>` is `T`, and
* `<exp>` has type `U` where `U` <: `T`.

Type annotation may be used to aid the type-checker when it cannot otherwise determine the type of `<exp>` or when one wants to constrain the inferred type, `U` of `<exp>` to a less-informative super-type `T` provided `U <: T`.

The result of evaluating `<exp> : <typ>` is the result of evaluating `<exp>`.

Note: type annotations have no-runtime cost and cannot be used to perform the (checked or unchecked) `down-casts` available in other object-oriented languages.

[[exp-decl]]
=== Declaration

The declaration expression `<dec>` has type `T` provided the declaration `<dec>` has type `T`.

Evaluating the expression `<dec>` proceed by evaluating `<dec>`, returning the result of `<dec>` but discarding the bindings introduced by `<dec>` (if any).


[[exp-debug]]
=== Debug

The debug expression `debug <exp>` has type `()` provided the expression `<exp>` has type `()`.

When the program is compiled or interpreted with (default) flag `--debug`, evaluating the expression `debug <exp>` proceeds by evaluating `<exp>`, returning the result of `<exp>`.

When the program is compiled or interpreted with flag `--release`, evaluating the expression `debug <exp>` immediately returns the unit value `()`.
The code for `<exp>` is never executed, nor is its code included in the compiled binary.

[[exp-paren]]
=== Parentheses

The parenthesized expression `( <exp> )` has type `T` provided `<exp>` has type `T`.

The result of evaluating `( <exp> )` is the result of evaluating `<exp>`.

[[exp-subsumption]]
=== Subsumption

Whenever `<exp>` has type `T` and `T <: U` (`T` subtypes `U`) then by
virture of _implicit subsumption_, `<exp>` also has type `U`
(without extra syntax).

In general, this means that an expression of a more specific type may
appear wherever an expression of a more general type is expected,
provided the specific and general types are related by subtyping.
