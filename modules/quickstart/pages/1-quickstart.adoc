= 1. Installing Tools

To complete the Hello, World! tutorial you need to install the canister SDK, Node.js and the Node package manager.

== 1.1 The Canister SDK (AKA "*dfx*") 

The Canister SDK used to develop on the IC is called `dfx` and it is maintained by the DFINITY foundation and is written in Motoko. There are other SDKs.

To install, one needs to run:
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----

To verify that it has properly installed:
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----

The terminal should look like this (at least version 0.9.2):

// === Backwards Incompatibility

// If you have previously created IC dapps before February 2022, you may need to do a clean start to complete tutorial. You can delete the SDK and associated profiles and re-install it. **Be sure to save your previous identities if they control dapps or ICP.** 

// Follow the instructions here: link:../developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove{outfilesuffix}[Install, upgrade, or remove software].

== 1.2 Node.js

Node.js is necessary for rendering the frontend assets and so is necessary to complete this tutorial. Note however that Node.js in not needed for canister development in general. 

This tutorial works best with node.js version higher than `16.0.0`.

There are many ways of installing node.js, including from link:https://nodejs.org/en/download[nodejs.org website].

Besides installing node.js, users need to also install:
* Node Package Manager (NPM).
* Node Version Manager (NVM), see link:https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating[installing NVM].

You are now ready to continue.

== Conclusion

You now have the SDK properly installed.
