[[net-quick-start]]
This _Quick Start_ scenario assumes that you are a new developer signing up for free cycles so that you can try out building the {IC}.

[[cycles-before]]
== Before you begin

Before you sign up to receive free cycles, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local **macOS** or **Linux** computer.
+
Currently, the {sdk-short-name} only runs on computers with a macOS or Linux operating system.

* You know how to perform common tasks—like opening a terminal and running commands—on your computer.

* You have a valid GitHub account to authenticate your identity.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-long-name} by running the following command in a terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
For more information about downloading and installing the {sdk-short-name}, see link:../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell or how to install software  on your computer, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers].

== Get the principal for your {IC} identity

The first time you use the {sdk-short-name}, the `+dfx+` command-line tool creates a `+default+` developer identity for you. This identity is represented by a *principal* data type and a textual representation of the principal often referred to as your *principal identifier*.

You'll need this principal identifier to get your free cycles.

To get your principal identifier:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.

. Verify that you have the {sdk-short-name} installed and it is in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
If the command displays the version number, you're all set.
. Display the textual representation of the principal for your current identity by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity get-principal
----
+
This command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
tsqwz-udeik-5migd-ehrev-pvoqv-szx2g-akh5s-fkyqc-zy6q7-snav6-uqe
....
. Copy the principal identifier so you have it available in the clipboard.

== Sign up for free cycles

To get your free cycles:

. Open a web brwoser and navigate to the link:https://dfinity-faucet-dev-demo.on.fleek.co[Cycles Faucet] URL.

. Click **Connect to GitHub** to authenticate your identity using your GitHub user name or your email address.

. Sign in to your GitHub account, then click **Authorize** to authorize the Cycles Faucet application.

. Paste your developer identity principal, then click **Continue**.

. Select the **Cycles Wallet** or **Dank Account** cycles management option, then click **Claim $100 worth of free cycles**.
+
When the cycles are transferred to the cycles wallet or the Dank account, the **Congrats!** page confirms the free cycles associated with your principal identifier.
+
For example
+
image:congrats.png[]
+
If you selected the **Dank Account** option, your cycles are deposited in the account on your behalf. No additional steps are necessary.
+
If you selected the **Cycles Wallet** option, continue to the next step to associate your new cycles wallet identifier with your developer identity principal.
. Copy the command displayed in the Cycles Faucet and paste it into the terminal to associate your principal identifier with your new cycles wallet canister on the network.
+
For example, run a command similar to the following in the terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity --network ic set-wallet 5fiwd-laaaa-aaaad-qaeyq-cai:
----
+
You are now ready to start building and deploying smart contracts on the {IC}.

== Build your first application

To try things out, you can deploy the default Hello application. 
The Hello application has just one function—called `+greet+`. 
The `+greet+` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello,{nbsp}everyone!** in a terminal if you run the application using the command-line or in an HTML page if you access the application in a browser.

To deploy your first application:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Check that you can connect to the {IC} by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx ping ic
----
+
If the connection is successful, you should see output similar to the following:
+
....
{
  "ic_api_version": "0.17.0"  "impl_hash": "029b46fa3385c17f9a33f1616156f5be956701ea7109fe94d22b6ff828514461"  "impl_version": "8a560f9510b0df9e747ffaede3b731f2ade9c0b7"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 129, 76, 14, 110, 199, 31, 171, 88, 59, 8, 189, 129, 55, 60, 37, 92, 60, 55, 27, 46, 132, 134, 60, 152, 164, 241, 224, 139, 116, 35, 93, 20, 251, 93, 156, 12, 213, 70, 217, 104, 95, 145, 58, 12, 11, 44, 197, 52, 21, 131, 191, 75, 67, 146, 228, 103, 219, 150, 214, 91, 155, 180, 203, 113, 113, 18, 248, 71, 46, 13, 90, 77, 20, 80, 95, 253, 116, 132, 176, 18, 145, 9, 28, 95, 135, 185, 136, 131, 70, 63, 152, 9, 26, 11, 170, 174]
}
....
. Create a new project named `+hello+` and chnage to the project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello && cd hello
----
+
If you use a different project name instead of `+hello+`, make note of the name you used. You'll need to use that project name in place of the `+hello+` project name throughout these instructions.
. Check that your cycles wallet balance by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx wallet --network ic balance
----
+
The command returns the balance for the your cycles wallet.
For example:
+ 
....
15430122328028812 cycles.
....
. Register, build, and deploy your first application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network ic
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
. Call the `+hello+` canister and the predefined `+greet+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network ic call hello greet everyone
----
+
Let's take a closer look at this example:
+
-- 

* Using the `+--network ic+` option indicates that the canister you want to call is deployed on the `+ic+` network. The `+ic+` network alias is an internally-reserved alias for accessing the {IC}.
* Note that the `+--network ic+` option must precede the operation subcommand, which, in this case, is the `+dfx canister call+` command.
* The `+hello+` argument specifies the name of the canister you want to call.
* The `+greet+` argument specifies the name of the function you want to call in the `+hello+` canister.
* The text string `+everyone+` is the argument that you want to pass to the `+greet+` function.
--
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....
. Rerun the `+dfx wallet balance+` command or refresh the browser to see your new cycle balance and recent activity.

== Next steps

Now that you have seen how to get free cycles to an {IC} trial and how to deploy an application on the {IC} network, you are ready to develop and deploy programs of your own.

You can find more detailed examples and tutorials to help you learn about how to use Motoko and how to develop applications for the Internet Computer throughout the documentation.

Here are some suggestions for where to go next:
