:toclevels: 3
:proglang: Motoko
:platform: Internet Computer platform
:IC: Internet Computer
:company-id: DFINITY
:sdk-short-name: DFINITY Canister SDK
:sdk-long-name: DFINITY Canister Software Development Kit (SDK)

The {sdk-long-name} provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you create programs to run on a locally-deployed {IC} replica node.
(You won’t be able to install your programs on an externally-managed Developer Network just yet, but that capability is coming soon.)

By developing programs that run on the {platform}, you can deploy secure, tamper-proof applications and provide web-based services without the restrictions or expense of a proprietary infrastructure, the complexities of database management and maintenance, or the investment in hardware required to run enterprise-scale software.

If you want to learn more about the {platform} and how it can transform distributed computing and the application landscape, check out link:https://dfinity.org/faq[Frequently Asked Questions] or the videos posted on the https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOyguKlTxoDK3HRzmGbLyAg[DFINITY Official Youtube Channel].

If you are ready to start developing applications to run on the {platform}, it only takes a few minutes to get up and running.

As a preview of the steps, the following diagram illustrates the basic work flow.

== Before you begin

Before you download and install this release of the SDK, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local macOS or Linux computer.
* You should have `+node.js+` installed if you want to include the default template files for front-end development in your project.

== Download and install

The most straightforward option for accessing the {sdk-short-name} is to download the SDK package from within a terminal shell on your local computer.
With this installation option, you can be logged on as any user and no additional software is required.

To download and install from a terminal shell:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, on macOS open the Applications folder, then open Utilities and double-click *Terminal*.
. Download and install the SDK package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
By default, this command installs the latest version of the {sdk-short-name}.
You can, however, install a specific version, if needed.
For example, if you want to test against a previous version, you can modify the command to include a version by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
DFX_VERSION=0.5.0 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the `+dfx+` command-line interface executable and its dependencies on your local computer.
+
[source,bash]
----

info: Installed /usr/local/bin/dfx
----

== Verify the SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the {platform} will be available on your local computer.

To verify the SDK is ready to use:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Check that you have the SDK developer command-line interface installed and the executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the developer command-line interface similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx 0.5.4
----
. Preview usage information for the other developer command-line interface subcommands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----
+
The command displays usage information for the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

[[create-a-new-project]]
== Create a new project

You are now ready to create a new project for your first sample application.

To create a new project directory for your first application:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a folder for your {IC} sample projects by running the following command in your home directory or current working folder:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/ic-projects
----
. Change to your sample projects folder.
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects
----
. Create a new project directory for your first application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello_world
----
+
The `+dfx new hello_world+` command creates a new `+hello_world+`
project, including a default project directory structure under the new
project name and a new Git repository for your project.
If you have `+node.js+` installed locally, creating a new project also adds some template front-end code and dependencies.
+
To ensure that project names are valid when used in JavaScript, Motoko, and other contexts, you should only use alphanumeric characters and underscores.
You cannot include dashes or any special characters.
+
The command displays output similar to the following excerpt:
+
[source,bash]
----
Fetching manifest https://sdk.dfinity.org/manifest.json
Creating new project "hello_world"...
CREATE       hello_world/src/hello_world/main.mo (107B)...
CREATE       hello_world/dfx.json (320B)...
CREATE       hello_world/.gitignore (189B)...
CREATE       hello_world/README.md (1.01KB)...
CREATE       hello_world/src/hello_world/public/index.js (155B)...
CREATE       hello_world/package.json (263B)...
CREATE       hello_world/webpack.config.js (1.76KB)...
----
. View the default directory structure by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l hello_world
----
+
By default, the project directory structure includes at least one source subdirectory, a template `+README.md+` file, and a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
Depending on whether you have `+node.js+` installed, your project directory might include some or all of the following files:
+
[source,bash]
----
hello_world/
├── README.md      # default project documentation
├── dfx.json       # project configuration file
├── node_modules   # libraries for front-end development
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src            # source files directory
|   └── hello_world
│       ├── main.mo
│       └── public
│           └── index.js
└── webpack.config.js
----
+
At a minimum, the default project directory includes the following folders and files:

* A default `README` file for documenting your project in the repository.
* A default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to set configurable options for your project.
* A default `+src+` directory for all of the source files required by your application.
+
The default `+src+` directory includes a template `+main.mo+` file that you can modify or replace to include your core programming logic.
+
Because this tutorial focuses on the basics of getting started, you are only going to use the `+main.mo+` file. 
If you have `+node.js+` installed, your project directory includes additional files and directories that you can use to define the front-end interface for your application.
The front-end development and template files in the `+public+` folder are discussed a little later.

== Reviewing template files for your first program

By default, creating a new project adds some template files to your project directory.
You can edit these template files to include your own code to speed up the development cycle. 
To try it out, you can use the default template files to create a simple program that prints a text string using {proglang} code.

To review the template files for your program:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello_world
----
. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor to review the default settings.
+
For example:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "hello_world": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/hello_world/public/index.js"
      },
      "main": "src/hello_world/main.mo"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "build": {
      "output": "canisters/"
    },
    "start": {
      "address": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8000,
      "serve_root": "canisters/hello_world/assets"
    }
  },
  "dfx": "0.5.4",
  "version": 1
}
----
+
You can leave the default settings as they are. 
The default settings enable you to build and deploy your `+hello_world+` project from the default `+main.mo+` source code as a WebAssembly module named `+hello_world+`.
. Close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.
. Change to the `+src/hello_world+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/hello_world
----
. Open the `+main.mo+` file in a text editor and review the code in the template script:
+
[source,bash]
----
actor {
    public func greet(name : Text) : async Text {
        return "Hello, " # name # "!";
    };
};
----
+
You might notice that this sample code does not define a `+main+` function, which some programming languages require. 
For {proglang}, the `+main+` function is implicit in the file itself.
The implicit `+main+` function is a common convention in some scripting languages, such as Python and Perl. 
+
Although the traditional first program "Hello, World!" example normally illustrates how you can print a string using a `+print+` or `+println+` function, that traditional program would not represent a typical use case for {proglang} programs that run on the {IC}.
+
We’ll explore code that uses `+actor+` objects and asynchronous message handling more a little later. 
For now, you can continue to the next section to build the simple program from the default `+main.mo+` file.
. Close the `+main.mo+` file to continue.

== Build the program

You are now ready to compile the default program into an executable WebAssembly module.

To build the program executable:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Navigate to the root of your `+hello_world+` project folder.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects/hello_world
----
+
Note that this step is required because you must run the `+dfx build+` command from within the project directory structure.
. Build the executable canister by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
The command displays output indicating that the build is successful.
+
For example, if you have `+node.js+` installed you should see output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Building canisters hello_world
Building frontend
Bundling frontend assets in the canister
----
. Verify that the `+canisters/hello_world+` directory created by the `+build+` command contains the WebAssembly and related application files by running the following command.
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l canisters/hello_world/
----
+
For example, the command returns output similar to the following if you have `+node.js+` installed locally:
+
[source,bash]
----
total 144
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff      8 Jan 28 13:30 _canister.id
drwxr-xr-x  4 pubs  staff    128 Jan 28 13:30 assets
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff     43 Jan 28 13:30 main.did
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff    117 Jan 28 13:30 main.did.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff    155 Jan 28 13:30 main.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff  53420 Jan 28 13:30 main.wasm
----
+
The `canisters/hello_world` directory contains the following key files:

* The `+_canister.id+` file contains a randomly-generated identifier for your compiled program.
* The `+main.did+` file contains an interface description for your program.
* The `+main.js+` file contains a JavaScript representation of the canister interface for your program. 
* The `+main.wasm+` file contains the compiled WebAssembly for your program.

The `+canisters/hello_world+` directory also contains an `+assets+` subdirectory for your front-end JavaScript, custom CSS, and HTML files. 
In addition to these files, the `+dfx build+` command creates an `+idl_` directory with an interface description file labeled with your canister identifier (for example, with a file name with the randomly-generated identifier similar to `+81DDA04F69F40FEEAC.did+`).

== Start the local network and deploy

You now have a program that can be deployed on your local replica network.

To deploy the program on your local network:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open, and navigate to your `+hello_world+` project directory.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
Depending on your platform and local security settings, you might see a warning displayed. 
If you are prompted to allow or deny incoming network connections, click *Allow*.
+
You can use the `+--background+` option to start the {IC} replica processes then run them in the background. If you use the `+--background+` option, you can continue to the next step without opening another terminal shell on your local computer.
+
If you don't specify the `+--background+` option, you must open a new terminal shell. 
For example, if you are in the Terminal application on macOS, click Shell, then click *New Window*.
You can then navigate to your `+hello_world+` project directory in the new terminal shell before continuing to the next step.
+
After you start the local network, you should see the `Internet Computer replica started` message and details about your current network configuration.
. Deploy your `+hello_world+` project on the local network by running the `+dfx canister install+` command and specifying a `+canister_name+` that matches the canister name specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
For this tutorial, the canister name is `+hello_world+` and the path to the compiled code for the canister you want to deploy is `+canisters/hello_world/main.wasm+`, so you can deploy the canister by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install hello_world
----
+
The command output displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
Installing code for canister hello_world, with canister_id ic:81DDA04F69F40FEEAC
----
. Call the predefined `+greet+` method in the program by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello_world greet "there" --type string
----
+
This example uses the `+dfx canister call+` command to pass "there" as an argument of type `+string+` to the `+greet+` function.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function (Hello, there!).
+
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
("*Hello, there!*")
----
. Stop the {IC} replica processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----

== View the default front-end

If you have `+node.js+` installed in your development environment, your project includes a simple front-end example that uses a template `+index.js+` JavaScript file and a sample `+index.html+` file for accessing the `+hello_world+` program in a browser.

To explore the default front-end template:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open, and navigate to your `+hello_world+` project directory.
. Open the `+src/hello_world/public/index.js+` file in a text editor and review the code in the template script:
+
[source,bash]
----
import hello_world from 'ic:canisters/hello_world';

hello_world.greet(window.prompt("Enter your name:")).then(greeting => {
  window.alert(greeting);
});
----
+
The template `+index.js+` file uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to describe the structure and content of a document on the web.
+
This sample file imports the canister you created and calls the `+greet+` function in a prompt window.
. Close the `+index.js+` file to continue.
. View the static assets created in the `canisters` directory by running following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l canisters/hello_world/assets/
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following if you have `+node.js+` installed.
+
[source,bash]
----
total 24
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff  1191 Jan 28 13:30 index.js
-rw-r--r--  1 pubs  staff  5524 Jan 28 13:30 index.js.map
----
+
These files were generated automatically by the `+dfx build+` command using node modules and the template `+index.js+` file.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
. Open a browser and navigate to the address and port number specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
By default, the URL uses the localhost address (`+127.0.0.1+`) and port number `+8000+`, so you can navigate to the front-end for the hello_world program using `+127.0.0.1:8000+` for the URL.
In addition to the host and port, the URL you specify needs to include `+canisterId+` parameter to identify the canister that you want the web server to display. 
To specify the canister, append the identifier using the following syntax:
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
?canisterId=ic:_canister_identifier_
----
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
http://localhost:8000/?canisterId=ic:81DDA04F69F40FEEAC
----
. Verify that you are prompted to type a greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:hello-world-prompt.png[Hello world prompt window]
. Type a greeting, then click *OK* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:hello-world-return.png[Hello world return string]

== Updating the SDK

If a new version of the SDK is available for download after your initial installation, you should install the updated version at your earliest convenience to get the latest fixes and enhancements as soon as possible.
You can use the `+dfx upgrade+` command to compare the version you have currently installed against the latest version available for download. 
If a newer version of `+dfx+` is available, the `+dfx upgrade+` command automatically downloads and installs the latest version. 

Note that you don't need to uninstall the software before installing the new version.
However, if you want to perform a clean installation rather than an upgrade, you can first uninstall the software as described in <<Uninstalling the SDK>>, then re-run the download and installation command.

For information about the features and fixes in the latest release, see the link:sdk-release-notes{outfilesuffix}[Release notes].

== Uninstalling the SDK

When you install the SDK, the installation script puts the required binary files in a local directory and creates a cache.
You can remove the SDK binaries and cache from your local computer by running the `+uninstall+` script located in the `.cache` folder.

For example:
[source,bash]
----
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
----

If you are uninstalling because you want to immediately reinstall a clean version of `dfx`, you can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
