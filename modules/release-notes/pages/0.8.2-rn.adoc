An overview of the {release} release:

- Breaking change in how to specify a controller to `dfx canister create`

== Changes to DFX

=== Breaking change: controller parameter for dfx canister create

Breaking change: The controller parameter for `dfx canister create` is now passed as a named parameter,
rather than optionally following the canister name.

Old: dfx canister create [canister name] [controller]
New: dfx canister create --controller <controller> [canister name]

=== dfx canister delete can now return cycles to a wallet or dank

By default `dfx canister delete` will return cycles to the default cycles wallet.
Cycles can be returned to a designated canister with `--withdraw-cycles-to-canister` and
cycles can be returned to dank at the current identity principal with `--withdraw-cycles-to-dank`
and to a designated principal with `--withdraw-cycles-to-dank-principal`.

=== dfx canister create now accepts multiple instances of --controller argument

It is now possible to create canisters with more than one controller by
passing multiple instances of the `--controller parameter to `dfx canister create`.

You will need to upgrade your wallet with `dfx wallet upgrade`, or `dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

=== dfx canister update-settings now accepts multiple instance of --controller argument

It is now possible to configure a canister to have more than one controller by
passing multiple instances of the `--controller parameter to `dfx canister update-settings`.

=== dfx canister info and dfx canister status now display all controllers

=== Fixed: dfx now respects $DFX_CONFIG_ROOT when looking for legacy credentials

Previously this would always look in `$HOME/.dfinity/identity/creds.pem`.


== Changes to Cycles Wallet

=== Added support for multiple controllers

You will need to upgrade your wallet with `dfx wallet upgrade`, or `dfx wallet --network ic upgrade`

== Changes to Replica

* Updated to https://smartcontracts.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html[Interface Spec 0.18.0]
** A canister has a set of controllers, instead of always one
* Added support for 64-bit stable memory
* The replica now goes through an initialization sequence, reported in its status
as `replica_health_status`.  Until this reports as `healthy`, queries or updates will
fail.
** `dfx start --background` waits to exit until `replica_health_status` is `healthy`.
** If you run `dfx start` without `--background`, you can call `dfx ping --wait-healthy`
to wait until the replica is healthy.

== Changes to Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.7 to 0.6.10

* Add Debug.trap : Text -> None (motoko-base #288)
* Introduce primitives for `Int` â‡” `Float` conversions (#2733)
* Fix crashing bug for formatting huge floats (#2737)
