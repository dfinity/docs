An overview of the {release} release:

Breaking change: Removed `--no-artificial-delay` option from `dfx start` and `dfx replica`


== Changes to DFX

=== Breaking change: Replaced `--no-artificial-delay` option with a sensible default

The `--no-artificial-delay` option not being the default has been causing a lot of confusion.
Now that we have measured in production and already applied a default of 600ms
to most subnets deployed, we set the same default for dfx and removed this option.

== Changes to Replica

== Changes to Motoko

Updated Motoko from 0.6.10 to 0.6.11
