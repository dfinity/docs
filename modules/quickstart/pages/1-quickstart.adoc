= 1. Installing Tools

To complete this 10-minute tutorial you only need two dependencies.

== 1.1 The Canister SDK (AKA "*dfx*") 

The Canister SDK used in this tutorial is called `dfx` and it is maintained by the DFINITY foundation. There are many SDKs and this is just one.

To install, one needs to run:
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----


To verify it is properly installed:
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----

The terminal should look like this (at least version 0.9.2):

== 1.2 Node.js

Node.js is not strictly necessary for canister smart contracts. It is necessary for rendering the frontend assets. 

This tutorial works best with node.js version higher than `16.*.*`.

There are many ways of installing node.js, including from link:https://nodejs.org/en/download[nodejs.org website].

Besides installing node.js, users need to also install:
* Node Package Manager (NPM).
* Node Version Manager (NVM), see link:https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating[installing NVM].

You are now ready to continue.

== Conclusion

You now have the SDK properly installed.
