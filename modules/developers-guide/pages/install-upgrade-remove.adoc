== What gets installed

The {sdk-short-name} installation script installs several components in default locations on your local computer.
The following table describes the development environment components that the installation script installs:

=== Core components in a versioned directory

The `~/.cache/dfinity/versions` directory stores one or more versioned subdirectories of the {sdk-short-name}. 
Each versioned subdirectory contains the all of the directories and files required for a specific version of the {sdk-short-name}.
For example, if you list the contents of the `~/.cache/dfinity/versions/0.9.2` directory you would see the following core components:

=== {proglang} base directory

The `+base+` directory in the versioned subdirectory of the {sdk-short-name} contains the {proglang} base library modules that are compatible with that version of the {sdk-short-name}. 
Because the {proglang} base library is evolving rapidly, you should only use the base modules that are packaged with the version of the {sdk-short-name} that you have installed.

=== Bootstrap directory

The `bootstrap` directory contains web server code that is deprecated. 
Beginning with version 0.7.0, agents can call an HTTP middleware server instead of the `bootstrap` code. 
This change enables canisters to respond to HTTP requests directly and operate more like traditional web-based applications.

== Upgrading to the latest version

If a new version of the {sdk-short-name} is available for download after your initial installation, you should install the updated version at your earliest convenience to get the latest fixes and enhancements as soon as possible.
You can use the `+dfx upgrade+` command to compare the version you have currently installed against the latest version available for download. 
If a newer version of `+dfx+` is available, the `+dfx upgrade+` command automatically downloads and installs the latest version. 

Note that you don't need to uninstall the software before installing the new version.
However, if you want to perform a clean installation rather than an upgrade, you can first uninstall the software as described in xref:remove[Removing the software], then re-run the download and installation command.

For information about the features and fixes in the latest release, see the xref:release-notes:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release notes].

[[remove]]
== Removing the software

When you install the {sdk-short-name}, the installation script puts the required binary files in a local directory and creates a cache.
You can remove the SDK binaries and cache from your local computer by running the `+uninstall+` script located in the `.cache` folder.

For example:
[source,bash]
----
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh
----

If you are uninstalling because you want to immediately reinstall a clean version of `dfx`, you can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
~/.cache/dfinity/uninstall.sh && sh -ci "$(curl -sSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
