= How to Deploy a "Hello, World!" Smart Contract/Dapp in 20 Minutes

This is a fast, minimalist tutorial for deploying a "Hello, World!" smart contract or dapp to the IC in 20 minutes or less. All that is necessary to run this tutorial is basic knowledge of using a terminal (no editing of code).

See the dapp on-chain: https://6lqbm-ryaaa-aaaai-qibsa-cai.ic0.app/ 

== Introduction

In this tutorial, we will deploy a simple `Hello` dapp which accepts a text argument as input, and returns the result as a greeting. For example, if you call the `greet` method with the text argument `Everyone`:

* on the command-line via dfx (see instructions below on how to install dfx), the dapp will return `Hello, Everyone!` in your terminal**

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx canister call hello greet everyone
$ "Hello, everyone"
----

* via the dapp in a browser, it will alert pop-up window reading `Hello, Everyone!`**

While the code comes ready out of the box for you, this dapp consists of back-end code written in Motoko, a programming language specifically designed for interacting with the Internet Computer (IC), and a simple webpack-based front-end. 

== Topics Discussed in this Tutorial

* *Canister smart contract/dapp* which are types of smart contracts that bundle code and state. As in this tutorial, it is common for a dapp to be composed of multiple canister smart contracts.

* *Cycles* which are the unit of measurement for resources consumed in the form of processing, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. For the sake of this tutorial, this is analogous to Ethereum's gas: it is what one needs to run their dapp, yet it is much more stable and less expensive for developers to use. Every canister has a cycles account to which resources consumed by the canister are charged. The Internet Computer's utility token (ICP) can be converted to cycles and transferred to a canister. ICP can always be converted to cycles using the current price of ICP measured in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights[SDR] using the convention that one trillion cycles correspond to one SDR. **In this tutorial, you can get free cycles from the cycles faucet.**

* A *cycles wallet* which is a type of canister that holds your cycles for you. You will use this canister to power up your dapps.

== 1. Installing Tools

To build a dapp, there are some tools which need to be installed.

== 2. Create a Default Project (1 min)

With the SDK installed, you can create the default "Hello, World!" project described in this tutorial. This project will have the necessary canister smart contract and frontend code.

== 3. Deploying Dapp on Local Machine (3 min)

With the project created, you can test it by deploying it on your local machine.

== 4. Acquiring Cycles to Deploy On-chain (10-15 min)

To deploy on-chain, you will need to add cycles to your account.

== 5. Deploying On-chain (1 min)

Now that you have cycles, you can deploy the "Hello, World!" dapp on-chain.

== 6. Conclusion

=== 6.1 Wrap-up: What you have done
Throughout this tutorial you have:

* Installed the Canister SDK
* Built and deployed a dapp locally
* Received free cycles to power your dapp
* Created a "cycles wallet" from which you can transfer cycles to any other dapps you want to power
* Deployed your dapp on-chain

=== 6.2 Using your free cycles to power other dapps

You can use the cycles you received earlier for other dapps.
