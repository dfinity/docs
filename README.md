# Contributing to the documentation

The [Internet Computer blockchain](https://dfinity.org/developers) is removing the limitations from smart contract software with a network that scales its capacity with demand and serves interactive web content directly to end users. 
If you are interested in learning more about the project, you can connect with other developers in the community through the [Developer Forum](https://forum.dfinity.org/) and follow us on social media for information about upcoming events and new developments.

If you would like to contribute to the documentation, see our [CONTRIBUTING](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE OF CONDUCT](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started.
