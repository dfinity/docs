You can also check out our https://github.com/dfinity/examples[Examples Repo], https://github.com/dfinity/awesome-dfinity[Awesome Dfinity], a curated set of open-source projects and examples from our community, or link:./hackathon-projects.html[Hackathon Projects]!

[[motoko-rust]]
== Motoko and Rust Examples

We first list the examples that are available in both Motoko _and_ Rust:

* link:hello{outfilesuffix}[Hello]: the dapp equivalent of _hello world_, with a separate backend and frontend canister serving a web page.

[[motoko]]
== Motoko Examples

[[motoko-playground]]
=== Motoko Playground

Some (but not all) of the following Motoko examples are available via the https://m7sm4-2iaaa-aaaab-qabra-cai.raw.ic0.app/[Motoko Playground]. The playground provides the simplest enviromnent for trying out pure Motoko examples without having to download and learn to use the SDK, but does not support applications with frontends.

=== Basic

This is collection of basic getting-started Motoko examples, which demonstrate basic concepts of the IC and the Motoko language. 

- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/actor_reference[actor_reference] -- IC management canister as an actor (reference).
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/counter[counter] -- basic (stable) variable demo.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/echo[echo] -- basic query function demo.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/factorial[factorial] -- basic factorial demo.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/hello-world[hello-world] -- basic hello world demo.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/hello_cycles[hello_cycles] -- Receive and transfer cycles and check your balance.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/whoami[whoami] -- a simple canister that reports the Principal of its caller.

=== Intermediate

The intermediate examples demonstrate how to use some of the basic concepts in common use cases. The examples show how to build simple backend functionalities in Motoko.

- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/classes[classes] -- dynamic actor (class) instantiation.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/pub-sub[pub-sub]-- multiple canisters, with publisher-subscriber inter-canister calls.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/quicksort[quicksort] -- sorting an array, via Quick Sort, in Motoko.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/simple-to-do[simple-to-do] -- CRUD-like demo service, sans a front end; see also: phone-book and superheroes.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/calc[calc] -- more advanced version of counter demo.

=== Minimal front end.

These two examples show how to create simple frontends in JavaScript. Where the previous examples did not provide a frontend, these two examples provide both a frontend and a backend.

- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/random_maze[random_maze] -- random maze generation, with IC-based randomness.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/cert-var[cert_var] -- simple certified variable (a single 32-bit number), with client-side certificate validation.

=== Full stack.

These examples demonstrates how to build dapps on the IC, with frontends based on React and TypeScript.  

- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/life[life] -- Conway's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life[Game of Life], running in a Motoko Canister. Demonstrates upgrades among three versions and state migration using stable variables. 
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/phone-book[phone-book] -- CRUD-like demo service.
- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko/superheroes[superheroes] -- a simple CRUD dapp. 
- https://github.com/krpeacock/auth-client-demo[Auth Client Demo] - simple authentication with Internet Identity.
- https://github.com/krpeacock/ic-avatar[IC-Avatar] - full-stack Motoko + React with more advanced authentication, image uploads, and optimistic updates.

[[rust]]
== Rust Examples

[[rust-beginner]]
=== Beginner

This Rust example is similar to the intermediate Motoko pub-sub example.

- https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/rust/pub-sub[Pub Sub]

[[rust-videos]]
=== Videos

These videos from our Community Conversations series cover an introduction to building dapps in Rust, and best practices for building dapps in Rust.
