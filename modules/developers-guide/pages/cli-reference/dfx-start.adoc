Use the `+dfx start+` command to start a local {IC} replica process and web server processes for the current project.
This command enables you to deploy canisters to the local {IC} network to test your programs during development.

Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure.
For example, if your project name is `+hello_world+`, your current working directory must be the `+hello_world+` top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories.

Alternatively, you can start the {IC} in the background by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----

If you run the {IC} in the background, however, be sure to stop the network before uninstalling or reinstalling the `+dfx+` execution environment by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----

You can view the current process identifier (`+pid+`) for the {IC} process started by `+dfx+`  by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
more .dfx/pid
