In this tutorial, you are going to write a program that creates a single actor and provides a few basic functions to increment a counter and illustrate persistence of a value.

For this tutorial, the actor is named `+Counter+`.
The program uses the `+currentValue+` variable to contain a natural number that represents the current value of the counter.
This program supports the following function calls:

* The `+increment+` function call updates the current value, incrementing by 1 (no return value).
* The `+get+` function call queries and returns the current value.
* The `+set+` function call updates the current value to an arbitrary numeric value you specify as an argument.

This tutorial provides a simple example of how you can increment a counter by calling functions on a deployed canister.
By calling the function to increment a value multiple times, you can verify that the variable state—that is, the value of the variable between calls—persists.

The following diagram provides a simplified overview of the workflow passing from the developer’s command-line environment to the {IC} network deployed locally:

As the diagram suggests, the network infrastructure and the development environment co-exist on the same computer in this tutorial.

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].
* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project directory for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} projects, if you are using one.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new my_counter
----
+
The command creates a new `+my_counter+` project and Git repository for your project.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd my_counter
----
[arabic]
. View the top-level directory structure of the new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following if you have `+node.js+` installed in your development environment:
+
....

....

== Modify the default configuration

You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default `+dfx.json+` configuration file to your project directory.
In this tutorial, you will modify the default settings to use a different name for the main program in your project.

To modify the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor and change the default `+main+` setting from `+main.mo+` to `+increment_counter.mo+`.
+
For example:
+
[source,json]
----
"main": "src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo",
----
+
For this tutorial, changing the name of the source file from `+main.mo+` to `+increment_counter.mo+` simply illustrates how the setting in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file determines the source file to be compiled.
+
In a more complex application, you might have multiple source files with dependencies that you need to manage using settings in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
You can leave the rest of the default settings as they are.
. Save your change and close the `+dfx.json+` file to continue.
. Change the name of the main program file in the source code directory to match the name specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file by running the following command
+
[source,bash]
----
mv src/my_counter/main.mo src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo
----

== Modify the default program

So far, you have only changed the name of the main program for your project.
The next step is to modify the code in the `+src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo+` file to define an actor named `+Counter+` and implement the `+increment+`, `+get+`, and `+set+` functions.

To modify the default template source code:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Open the `+src/my_counter/increment_counter.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+increment_counter.mo+` file:
+
[source.copy,motoko,no-repl]
----
include::example$counter.mo[]
----
+
Let's take a closer look at this sample program:
+
--

* You can see that the `+currentValue+` variable declaration in this example includes the `+stable+` keyword to indicate the state—the value that can be set, incremented, and retrieved—persists.
+
This keyword ensures that the value for the variable is unchanged when the program is upgraded. 
* The declaration for the `+currentValue+` variable also specifies that its type is a natural (`+Nat+`) number.
* The program includes two public update methods—the `+increment+` and `+set+` functions—and one a query method, in this case, the `+get+` function.
--
+
For more information about stable and flexible variables, see link:language-guide:upgrades{outfilesuffix}[Stable variables and upgrade methods] in the link:language-guide:motoko{outfilesuffix}[_{proglang} Programming Language Guide_].
+
For more information about the differences between a query and an update, see link:../introduction-key-concepts{outfilesuffix}#query-calls[query calls] in link:../introduction-key-concepts{outfilesuffix}#canister-state[Canisters include both program and state].
. Save your changes and close the file to continue.

== Start the local network

Before you can build the `+my_counter+` project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.

Starting the network locally requires a `+dfx.json+` file, so you should be sure you are in your project's root directory.
For this tutorial, you should have two separate terminal shells, so that you can start and see network operations in one terminal and manage your project in another.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer.
. Navigate to the root directory for your project, if necessary.
+
--
* You should now have **two terminals** open.
* You should have the **project directory** as your **current working directory**.
--
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start
----
+
After you start the local network, the terminal displays messages about network operations.
. Leave the terminal that displays network operations open and switch your focus to your original terminal where you created your new project.

== Register canister identifiers

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register with the network to generate unique, network-specific *canister identifiers* for your project.

To register canister identifiers for the local network:

. Check that you are still in your project directory, if needed.
. Register unique canister identifiers for the canisters in the project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister create --all
----
+
The command displays the network-specific canister identifiers for the canisters defined in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
....
Creating canister "my_counter"...
"my_counter" canister created with canister id: "rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai"
Creating canister "my_counter_assets"...
"my_counter_assets" canister created with canister id: "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"
....

[[build-counter]]
== Build and deploy the program

Now that you have a main program with an actor that increments a value, a connection to the {IC} network, and network-specific canister identifiers, you are ready to compile the program into an executable WebAssembly module that can be deployed on your local network.

To build and deploy the program:

. Check that you are still in your project directory by running the `+pwd+` command, if necessary.
. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
....
+
Because you are running the {IC} network locally, the WebAssembly modules created by the `+dfx build+` command for your program are stored in the `+.dfx/local/canisters+` directory.
. Verify that the `+.dfx/local/canisters/my_counter+` directory contains the WebAssembly and interface description files by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ls -l .dfx/local/canisters/my_counter
----
. Deploy the canister you created by running a `+dfx canister install+` command and specifying the _canister_name_.
+
Because this tutorial doesn't yet include any front-end assets, you can deploy the back-end program—the program defined in the `+increment_counter.mo+` file—by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install my_counter
----

== Invoke methods on the deployed canister

After successfully deploying the canister, you can simulate an end-user invoking the methods provided by the canister.
For this tutorial, you invoke a `+get+` method to query the value of a counter, an `+increment+` method that increments the counter each time it is called, and a `+set+` method to pass an argument to update the counter to an arbitrary value you specify.

To test invoking methods on the deployed canister:

[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+get+` function, which reads the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
The command returns the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable as zero:
+
....
(0)
....
[arabic]
. Run the following command to invoke the `+increment+` function to increment the value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister by one:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment
----
+
This command increments the value of the variable—changing its state—but does not return the result.
[arabic]
. Rerun the following command to get the current value of the `+currentValue+` variable on the deployed canister:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
The command returns the updated value of the `+currentValue+` variable as one:
+
....
(1)
....
[arabic]
. Run additional commands to experiment with invoking other methods and using different values.
+
For example, try commands similar to the following to set and return the counter value:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter set '(987)'
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
Returns the current value of 987.
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call my_counter increment
dfx canister call my_counter get
----
+
Returns the incremented value of 988.

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesn’t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
