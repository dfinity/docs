== 2. Create a Default Project (1 min)

=== 2.1 Launch a new project 
Dapps on the Internet Computer start as projects, which are initiated by using the dfx parent command and its subcommands. You create projects using the `dfx` parent command and its subcommands. This tutorial starts with the default sample dapp to illustrate how to create a dapp using the starter files in a project. When you create a new project, the `dfx` command-line interface adds a default project directory structure to your workspace. 

To create a new project for your first application:

==== 2.1.1 Open a terminal shell on your computer and create a new project named "hello"

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx new hello
----

The `dfx new hello` command creates a new project directory named `hello`, template files, and a new `hello` Git repository for your project. Your terminal should look like this:

image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-1.png[dfx new]

image:quickstart/dfx-new-hello-2.png[dfx new]

==== 2.1.2 Move to your project directory
[source,bash]
----
$ cd hello
----

Your directory should look like this:

image:quickstart/cd-hello.png[cd new]

== Conclusion

You now have the default project created ready to be deployed locally.
