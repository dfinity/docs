[[quick-start-intro]]
This {sdk-long-name} provides tools, sample code, and documentation to help you create programs to run on the {IC} network.
The _Quick Start_ tutorial assumes that you are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time and illustrates how to create, build, and deploy your first application. 

To keep the instructions simple and focused on the task at hand, the _Quick start_ is split into two scenarios:

* In the link:local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Local development] scenario, you create and deploy the sample application with {IC} processes that run _locally to simulate connecting to the network_.

* In the link:network-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Network deployment] scenario, you create the sample application locally but _connect to the {IC} running remotely_ on computers in an external data center.

== Default application

Both scenarios build and deploy a simple Hello application that has just one functionâ€”called `+greet+`. The `+greet+` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello,{nbsp}everyone!** in a terminal if you run the application using the command-line or in an alert pop-up window if you access the application in a browser.
