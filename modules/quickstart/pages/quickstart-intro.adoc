This is a fast, minimalist tutorial for deploying a "hello world" dapp to the the Internet Computer (IC) in 10 minutes or less. All that is necessary to run this tutorial is basic knowledge of using a terminal (no editing of code).

See a version of this dapp running on-chain: https://6lqbm-ryaaa-aaaai-qibsa-cai.ic0.app/

In this tutorial, we will deploy a simple `Hello` dapp. This dapp is composed of two link:https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Glossary#C[canister smart contracts] (one for backend and one for frontend).

The dapp's functionality is simple: it accepts a text argument as input, and returns the result as a greeting. For example, if you call the `greet` method with the text argument `Everyone`:

* on the command-line via dfx (see instructions below on how to install dfx), the dapp will return `Hello, Everyone!` in your terminal**

[source,bash]
----
$ dfx canister call hello greet Everyone
$ "Hello, Everyone"
----

* via the dapp in a browser, it will alert pop-up window reading `Hello, Everyone!`**

This dapp consists of back-end code written in link:language-guide/motoko[Motoko], a programming language specifically designed for interacting with the (IC), and a simple webpack-based front-end. 

== Topics Discussed in this Tutorial

* *Canisters* are the type of smart contracts that are installed on the IC. They contain the code that to be run and a state that is produced as a result of running the code. As is the case this tutorial, it is common for a dapp to be composed of multiple canister smart contracts.

* *link:developers-guide/concepts/tokens-cycles[Cycles]* are the unit of measurement for resources consumed in the form of processing, memory, storage, and network bandwidth. For the sake of this tutorial, it is analogous to Ethereum's gas: it is what one needs to run their dapp, yet it is stable and less expensive for developers to use. Every canister has a cycles account to which resources consumed by the canister are charged. The Internet Computer's utility token (ICP) can be converted to cycles and transferred to a canister. ICP can always be converted to cycles using the current price of ICP measured in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights[SDR] using the convention that one trillion cycles correspond to one SDR. **In this tutorial, you can get free cycles from the cycles faucet.**

* A *link:developers-guide/default-wallet[cycles wallet]* which is a type of canister that holds your cycles for you. You will use this canister to power up your dapps.

== 1. Installing Tools

To build a dapp, there are some tools which need to be installed. 

link:1-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[1-Installing Tools] 

== 2. Create a Default Project (1 min)

With the SDK installed, you can create the default "Hello, World!" project described in this tutorial. This project will have the two canisters you need (backend and frontend).

link:2-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[2-Create default project] 

== 3. Deploying Dapp on Local Machine (3 min)

With the project created, you can test it by deploying it on your local machine. 

link:3-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[3-Deploying dapp locally] 

== 4. Acquiring Cycles to Deploy On-chain (5 min)

To deploy on-chain, you will need to add cycles to your account.

link:4-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[4-Acquiring cycles] .

== 5. Deploying On-chain (1 min)

Now that you have cycles, you can deploy the "Hello, World!" dapp on-chain.

== Conclusion

In 10 minutes you have deployed an entire dapp on-chain. This is rare among other smart contract platforms because the IC has dapps fully on-chain (both backend and frontend).

=== Wrap-up: What you have done
You have done the following in this tutorial:

* Installed the Canister SDK
* Built and deployed a dapp locally
* Received free cycles to power your dapp
* Created a "cycles wallet" from which you can transfer cycles to any other dapps you want to power
* Deployed your dapp on-chain

=== Using your free cycles to power other dapps

You can use the cycles you received earlier for other dapps.

== Troubleshooting

=== Resources

* Developers who hit any blockers are encouraged to search or post in the link:https://forum.dfinity.org[IC developer forum].

* link:https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Internet_Computer_wiki[Internet Computer wiki].

=== Starting from scratch

If you wish to start from scratch, You can delete the SDK and associated profiles and re-install it. **Be sure to save your previous identities if they control dapps or ICP.** 

Follow the instructions here: link:../developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove{outfilesuffix}[Install, upgrade, or remove software].

== More Sample Code

Once you finish your first dap, you can see more robust sample code (e.g. DAOs, NFTs, etc...) in link:../samples/index{outfilesuffix}[Sample code and dapps].
