[[net-quick-start]]
This _Quick Start_ scenario assumes that you are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time and deploying the default project on the {IC} network **running remotely**.

If you are only deploying projects in a local development environment, see the link:local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Local development] scenario.

To get started, let's build and deploy a simple Hello application that has just one function—called `+greet+`. 
The `+greet+` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello,{nbsp}everyone!** in a terminal if you run the application using the command-line or in an HTML page if you access the application in a browser.

[[net-before]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install this release of the {sdk-short-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local **macOS** or **Linux** computer.
+
Currently, the {sdk-short-name} only runs on computers with a macOS or Linux operating system.

* You have provided the {company-id} Foundation with a principal associated with your user identity and have received a **cycles wallet** canister identifier in return.
+
A wallet canister with **cycles** is required to deploy and manage applications on the {IC}.
Once you have a default cycles wallet associated with your `default` identity on the network, you can use that wallet to create additional wallets or to create additional canisters for other services.

* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to access the default front-end for the default project.

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer or how to install `node.js`, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers].
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Download and install>>.

[[net-download-sdk]]
== Download and install

You can download the latest version of the {sdk-long-name} directly from within a terminal shell on your local computer.

To download and install:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download and install the {sdk-short-name} package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
DFX_VERSION=0.7.0-beta.4 sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) and its dependencies on your local computer.
. Type `+y+` and press kbd:[Return] to continue with the installation.
+
The command displays information about the components being installed on the local computer.

[[net-verify-sdk-version]]
== Verify the SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the {platform} will be available on your local computer.

To verify the SDK is ready to use:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Check that you have the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) installed and the `+dfx+` executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the `+dfx+` command-line executable similar to the following:
+
....
dfx 0.7.0-beta.4
....
. Preview usage information for the other `+dfx+` command-line sub-commands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----
+
The command displays usage information for the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

[[net-new-project]]
== Create a new project

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You create projects using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.
Creating a new project with `+dfx+` adds a default project directory structure to your development workspace with template files to get you started.

To create a new project for your first application:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----
+
The `+dfx new hello+` command creates a new `+hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+hello+` Git repository for your project.
+
If you use a different project name instead of `+hello+`, make note of the name you used. You'll need to use that project name in place of the `+hello+` project name throughout these instructions.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

[[ping-the-network]]
== Check the connection to the network

Before you can deploy your first project on the {IC}, you need to connect to the network gateway running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.
There is a reserved network alias that you can use to access the {IC} running remotely on nodes in data centers. The network alias is a system setting that's defined internally, so there's nothing you need to configure in your projects by default.

To check your connection to the {IC} network:

[arabic]
. Check that you are in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Check the current status of the {IC} network and your ability to connect to it by running the following command for the network alias `+alpha+`:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx ping alpha
----
+
If the `+alpha+` network alias for the {IC} network gateway is not configured in your project `+dfx.json+` file, you might see a `+ComputeNetworkNotFound+` error.
To manually specify the network provider for the {IC} network, open the `+dfx.json+` file in a text editor and add the following under the `+networks+` key:
+
[source,json]
----
    "alpha": {
      "providers": [
        "https://boundary.dfinity.network"
      ],
      "type": "persistent"
    }  
----
+

NOTE: If you are manually updating the `+dfx.json+` file, you need to add a comma after the brace (`+}+`) that separates the `+alpha+` network definition from the `+local+` network definition.

. Verify that the `+dfx ping alpha+` command returns information about the {IC} network to which you are connecting.
+
For example, you should see output similar to the following:
+
....
{
  "ic_api_version": "0.17.0"  "impl_hash": "9460c743a55d508df1946394c3dfc9c12c6481eeab650720b72b2031febfb243"  "impl_version": "0.1.0"  "root_key": [48, 129, 130, 48, 29, 6, 13, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 12, 43, 6, 1, 4, 1, 130, 220, 124, 5, 3, 2, 1, 3, 97, 0, 151, 13, 186, 126, 73, 184, 201, 141, 177, 136, 195, 207, 252, 10, 168, 212, 93, 65, 147, 200, 194, 100, 124, 104, 96, 177, 203, 236, 241, 76, 134, 145, 67, 217, 210, 223, 45, 249, 42, 204, 122, 236, 242, 64, 223, 248, 162, 6, 18, 20, 155, 212, 102, 169, 180, 240, 57, 226, 101, 162, 123, 41, 36, 57, 252, 45, 186, 229, 131, 139, 88, 207, 20, 161, 61, 223, 99, 129, 80, 199, 178, 84, 115, 228, 51, 41, 62, 204, 134, 158, 19, 200, 109, 191, 62, 201]
}
....
. Verify your principal exists on the network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity --network=alpha get-principal
----
+
The command should display a textual representation of your identity similar to the following:
+
....
zen7w-sjxmx-jcslx-ey4hf-rfxdq-l4soz-7ie3o-hti3o-nyoma-nrkwa-cqe
....
+

IMPORTANT: You should note that this principal is directly associated with a specific cycles wallet canister identifier. If you change or remove the identity associated with the principal, you also lose access to the cycles wallet it controls.

[[set-wallet]]
== Validate the wallet application

You must have a wallet canister with ICP tokens or a cycles wallet with enough cycles available to create, deploy, and manage applications that run on the {IC}.
If you submitted a textual representation of a principal to the {company-id} Foundation, you should have received a default cycles wallet canister identifier in return.

Note that upgrades to the {IC} have changed the encoding for principals and new wallet canister identifiers. If you submitted a principal and received a wallet prior to the current release, it is likely that the principal and wallet canister are no longer valid and you should generate a new principal after you upgrade the {sdk-short-name} to the latest version.

To validate your wallet for the network:

. Associate the wallet canister identifier you received for the network with your identity by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source.bash]
----
dfx identity --network=alpha set-wallet <WALLET-CANISTER-ID>
----
+
For example, if `47ung-kiaaa-aaaaa-qaaha-cai` is your default cycles wallet identifier, you would run the following command:
+
....
dfx identity --network=alpha set-wallet 47ung-kiaaa-aaaaa-qaaha-cai
....
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
Setting wallet for identity 'default' on network 'alpha' to id '47ung-kiaaa-aaaaa-qaaha-cai'
Checking availability of the canister on the network...
....
. Check that your wallet canister is properly configured and holds a balance of cycles by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --no-wallet --network=alpha call <WALLET-CANISTER-ID> wallet_balance
----
+
The command returns the balance for the wallet canister identifier you specified as a record using Candid format.
For example, the command might display a record with an `+amount+` field (represented by the hash `+3_573_748_184+`) and a balance of 99,991,425,128,012 cycles like this:
+ 
....
(record { 3_573_748_184 = 99_991_425_128_012 })
....
+
Using the command-line to call the wallet canister lets you quickly verify that your wallet is available and ready to use. But results returned in Candid format can be difficult to read, so let's take another look at your wallet from a web browser.
. Open a web browser and navigate to the wallet application front-end by using a URL similar to the following:
+
....
https://<WALLET-CANISTER-ID>.boundary.ic0.app
....
+
The first time you access the application, you see a notice that you are using an Anonymous Device and are prompted to authenticate your identity, authorize access to the wallet, and register your device.
+
. Click *Authenticate* to continue then click *Create Profile*.
+
Use a security key or another form of authentication such as touch ID to create your profile.
If prompted, click *Allow* to continue authentication using the method of your choice. 
. Review the profile displayed, then click *Next* to continue.
+
For example:
+

image:your-profile.png[]
After successfully creating the profile, you are prompted to authorize the session.
For example: 
+

image:auth-session.png[]
. Authorize access to the wallet application by clicking *Allow*, confirming your identity with your security key or other authentication method, then click *Finish*.
. Register the device you are using for this session by copying the command displayed in the *Register Your device* page and running it in a terminal.
+
For example, call the `+authorize+` method for the cycles wallet canister with a command similar to the following:
+
....
dfx canister --no-wallet --network alpha call "47ung-kiaaa-aaaaa-qaaha-cai" authorize '(principal "mkqvz-rnwpc-bsdyz-krgdo-f3yyo-fytfg-sv2y7-lnsua-at7lo-gtylc-2qe")'
....
+
Be sure that the command you copy has the `+--no-wallet+` option and the correct network (`+alpha+`) alias.
You should recognize the canister identifier—in this example, 47ung-kiaaa-aaaaa-qaaha-cai—as the cycles wallet associated with your identity.
If this is your first wallet on the network, however, you might not recognize the principal being authorized. The use of a different principal is the expected behavior in this case. 
+
When the browser refreshes after running the `+authorize+` command, the cycles wallet for your principal account is displayed.
. View your cycles balance and activity in the browser.
+
For example:
+
image::cycles-wallet.png[]

[[net-deploy]]
== Register, build, and deploy the application

After you connect to the {IC} network and validate your wallet, you can register, build, and deploy your sample application.

To deploy your first application on the {IC}:

. In your terminal shell, check that you are still in the root directory for your project.
. Ensure that `+node+` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----
+
For more information about this step, see link:../developers-guide/webpack-config{outfilesuffix}#troubleshoot-node[Ensuring node is available in a project].
////
. Deposit some initial cycles for your application to use by running the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network alpha call --with-cycles 10000000000000 aaaaa-aa deposit_cycles "(record { canister_id = principal \"$(dfx canister --network alpha id hello)\" })"

dfx canister --network alpha call --with-cycles 10000000000000 aaaaa-aa deposit_cycles "(record { canister_id = principal \"$(dfx canister --network alpha id hello_assets)\" })"
----
+
These commands are required to provide a initial cycles balance for creating the `+hello+` and `+hello_assets+` canisters.
+
You **must** specify an initial cycle balance greater than one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) to deploy a canister with cycles.
////
. Register, build, and deploy your first application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network=alpha --with-cycles 20000000000000
----
+
--
* The `+--network+` option specifies the network alias or URL for deploying the application.
+
This option is required to install on the {IC} running remotely.
* The `+--with-cycles+` option specifies the number of initial cycles you want to transfer from your wallet to the application you are deploying.
+
This option is required because a canister must have cycles to be deployed on the {IC} running remotely.
+
You **must** specify an initial cycle balance greater than one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) to deploy a canister with cycles.
--
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
+
For example, this step registers two network-specific identifiers—one for the `+hello+` main program and one for the `+hello_assets+` front-end user interface—and installation information similar to the following:
+
....

Deployed canisters.
....
. Call the `+hello+` canister and the predefined `+greet+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=alpha call hello greet everyone
----
+
Let's take a closer look at this example:
+
-- 

* Using the `+--network=alpha+` option indicates that the canister you want to call is deployed on the `+alpha+` network. The `+alpha+` network alias is an internally-reserved alias for accessing the {IC}.
* Note that the `+--network=alpha+` option must precede the operation subcommand, which, in this case, is the `+dfx canister call+` command.
* The `+hello+` argument specifies the name of the canister you want to call.
* The `+greet+` argument specifies the name of the function you want to call in the `+hello+` canister.
* The text string `+everyone+` is the argument that you want to pass to the `+greet+` function.
--
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....
. Refresh the browser to see your new cycle balance and recent activity.
+
For example:
+

image:wallet-after-hello-deploy.png[]
+
You might have noticed that deploying your project automatically generated a wallet for your `+default+` identity.
This wallet canister is preconfigured with cycles and provides a few basic functions that enable you to experiment with sending and receiving cycles without requiring an account with ICP tokens.
+
If you didn't notice the wallet canister identifier when you ran `+dfx deploy+`, you can look it up now by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity --network=ic get-wallet
----
. Check the cycle balance for your default wallet canister by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=ic call <WALLET-CANISTER-ID> wallet_balance
----
+
This command returns the balance for the wallet canister identifier you specified using the Candid syntax for `+record+` data types. 
For example, the command might display a record with an `+amount+` field (represented by the hash `+3_573_748_184+`) and a
balance of 99,999.974,174,602 cycles like this:
+
....
(record { 3_573_748_184 = 99_999_974_174_602 })
....
. Call the `+greet+` function again with a different argument.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=ic call hello greet '("San Francisco")'
----
. Rerun the command to check the cycle balance for your wallet.
+
For example, you might run a command similar to the following if the wallet canister identifier is `+oi7fh-tiaaa-aaaab-aahpq-cai+`:
+
....
dfx canister --network=ic call oi7fh-tiaaa-aaaab-aahpq-cai wallet_balance
....
+
Note that in the new balance, a small number of cycles have been deducted from the previous total of cycles available.
For example:
+
....
(record { 3_573_748_184 = 99_999_974_082_913 })
....
+
In this example, the new balance is 99,999,974,082,913 cycles.

[[quickstart-frontend]]
== Test the application front-end

Now that you have verified that your application has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let's verify that you can access the front-end using your web browser.

To access the application front-end:

. Open a browser.
. Navigate to the front-end for the application using a URL that consists of the `+hello_assets+` identifier and the `+boundary.ic0.app+` suffix.
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
....
https://zeorx-myaaa-aaaaa-qaaya-cai.boundary.ic0.app
....
+
Navigating to this URL displays the HTML entry page for the template application.
For example:
+
image:net-front-end-prompt.png[HTML page with prompt]

. Type a greeting, then click *Click Me* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:net-result.png[Hello, Everyone! greeting]
. Return to the browser window or tab that displays the cycles wallet and refresh the browser to see how your recent activity affects the cycle balance.
+
image:cycles-wallet-new-balance.png[]

== Create a wallet for another identity

. In your terminal shell, create a second identity by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity new sf-wallet
----
. Set the new identity to be your currently-active context by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity use sf-wallet
----
+
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
Using identity: "sf-wallet".
....
. Get the principal for the new `+sf_admin+` user identity by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx identity get-principal
----
The command displays output similar to the following:
+
....
vpqee-nujda-46rtu-4noo7-qnxmb-zqs7g-5gvqf-4gy7t-vuprx-u2urx-gqe
....
. In your cycles wallet, click the plus (*+*) icon to display the list of actions available, then click *Create a Wallet*.
. Paste the principal for the new identity you created in the controller field, specify the number of cycles for the new wallet, then click *Create*.
+
image:create-wallet.png[]
////
. Copy the canister identifier for the new wallet, then click *Okay* to close the new canister confirmation pop-up.
+

image:new-id.png[]
. Associate the new cycles wallet with the new identity by running a command similar to the following:
+
....
dfx identity --network=alpha set-wallet h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai
....
+
In this example, the new identity is named `sf-wallet` and we are running the `set-wallet` command with `sf-wallet` as the current identity context, so the command displays output like this:
+
....
Setting wallet for identity 'sf-wallet' on network 'alpha' to id 'h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai'
Checking availability of the canister on the network...
....
+
////
You now have a new principal and a new cycles wallet canister that you can use for testing or share with someone else to give them cycles for a service.
For example, you might want to register a new canister that has the new wallet as its controller.

=== Explore other tasks from the cycles wallet

You can register a new empty canister from the cycles wallet by clicking *Create a Canister*.
You can send cycles to any canister for which you have an identifier by clicking *Send Cycles*.
To perform other tasks, you can call your cycles wallet from the command line.
For example, to add another principal as a controller, you can run a command similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=alpha --no-wallet call f3yw6-7qaaa-aaaab-qaabq-cai add_controller '(principal "vpqee-nujda-46rtu-4noo7-qnxmb-zqs7g-5gvqf-4gy7t-vuprx-u2urx-gqe")'
----

For more information about the methods available in the default cycles wallet, see link:../developers-guide/default-wallet{outfilesuffix}[Use the default cycles wallet].

=== Create a wallet for someone else

If you are creating a cycles wallet for someone else to help them get on the network, the steps are similar to creating a second wallet for yourself but you will need that person's principal identifier. 

To create a wallet for someone else:

. Ensure that the person you want to create a wallet for takes these steps:
+
--

* Downloads and installs the {sdk-short-name}.
* Runs the `dfx identity get-principal` command.
* Sends you the textual representation of his or her principal.

--
+
After you have the principal identifier, continue to the next step.
. Use the cycles wallet application front-end or `+wallet_create_wallet+` method to create a wallet with the controller set to the principal identifier associated with the person you are creating the wallet for.
. Use the cycles wallet `+get_controllers+` method to verify that the list of controllers for the new wallet includes the new principal identifier.
. Use the cycles wallet `+remove_controller+` method to remove your principal identifier as a controller of the wallet you created for someone else.

For more information about the methods available in the default cycles wallet, see link:../developers-guide/default-wallet{outfilesuffix}[Use the default cycles wallet].
