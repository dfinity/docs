= dfx deploy
:sdk-short-name: DFINITY Canister SDK

Use the `+dfx deploy+` command to register, build, and deploy an application locally or on a specified network.
By default, all canisters defined in the project `+dfx.json+` configuration file are deployed.

This command simplifies the developer workflow by enabling you to run one command instead of running the following commands as separate steps:

....
dfx canister create --all
dfx build
dfx canister install -all
....

Note that you can only run this command from within the project directory structure.
For example, if your project name is `+hello_world+`, your current working directory must be the `+hello_world+` top-level project directory or one of its subdirectories.

== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy [flag] [option] [canister_name]
----

|Flag |Description
|`+-h+`, `+--help+` |Displays usage information.
|`+-V+`, `+--version+` |Displays version information.

|Option |Description

|`+--network <network>+` |Overrides the network to connect to. 
By default, the local network is used.

|`+--argument <argument>+` |Specifies an argument using Candid syntax to pass to the canister during deployment.
Note that this option requires you to define an actor class in the {proglang} program.

=== Arguments

You can specify the following arguments for the `+dfx deploy+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<36%,<64%",options="header"]
|===

|Argument |Description

|`+canister_name+` |Specifies the name of the canister you want to register, build, and deploy.
Note that the canister name you specify must match at least one name in the `+canisters+` section of the `+dfx.json+` configuration file for the project.
If you don't specify a canister name, `dfx deploy` will deploy all canisters defined in the `+dfx.json+` file.
|===

== Examples

You can use the `+dfx deploy+` command to deploy all or specific canisters locally or on a specified network.

For example, to deploy the `+hello+` project on the `+ic-pubs+` network provider configured in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file, you can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy hello --network ic-pubs
----

To deploy a project locally and pass a single argument to the installation step, you can run a command similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy hello_actor_class --argument '("from DFINITY")'
----

Note that currently you must use an actor class in your {proglang} program.
In this example, the `+dfx deploy+` command specifies an argument to pass to the `+hello_actor_class+` canister.
The main program for the `+hello_actor_class+` canister looks like this:

....
actor class Greet(name: Text) {
    public query func greet() : async Text {
        return "Hello, " # name # "!";
    };
};
....
