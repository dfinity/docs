[[net-quick-start]]
This _Quick Start_ scenario assumes that you are installing the {sdk-short-name} for the first time and deploying the default project on the {IC} network **running remotely**.

If you are only deploying projects in a local development environment, see the link:local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}[Local development] scenario.

To get started, let's build and deploy a simple Hello application that has just one function—called `+greet+`. 
The `+greet+` function accepts one text argument and returns the result with a greeting similar to **Hello,{nbsp}everyone!** in a terminal if you run the application using the command-line or in an alert pop-up window if you access the application in a browser.

[[net-before]]
== Before you begin

Before you download and install this release of the {sdk-short-name}, verify the following:

* You have an internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local **macOS** or **Linux** computer.
+
Currently, the {sdk-short-name} only runs on computers with a macOS or Linux operating system.

////
* You have provided the {company-id} Foundation with a principal associated with your user identity and have received a **wallet canister identifier** in return.
+
A wallet canister with **cycles** is required to deploy and manage applications on the {IC}.
////
* You have `+node.js+` installed if you want to access the default front-end for the default project.

If you aren’t sure how to open a new terminal shell on your local computer or how to install `node.js`, see link:newcomers{outfilesuffix}[Preliminary steps for newcomers].
If you are comfortable meeting the prerequisites without instructions, continue to <<Download and install>>.

[[net-download-sdk]]
== Download and install

You can download the latest version of the {sdk-long-name} directly from within a terminal shell on your local computer.

To download and install:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer.
+
For example, open Applications, Utilities, then double-click *Terminal* or press kbd:[{commandkey} + spacebar] to open Search, then type `terminal`.
. Download and install the {sdk-short-name} package by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"
----
+
This command prompts you to read and accept the license agreement before installing the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) and its dependencies on your local computer.
. Type `+y+` and press kbd:[Return] to continue with the installation.
+
The command displays information about the components being installed on the local computer.

[[net-verify-sdk-version]]
== Verify the SDK is ready to use

If the installation script runs without any errors, everything you need to start developing programs that run on the {platform} will be available on your local computer.

To verify the SDK is ready to use:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Check that you have the {company-id} execution command-line interface (CLI) installed and the `+dfx+` executable is available in your PATH by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----
+
The command displays version information for the `+dfx+` command-line executable similar to the following:
+
....
dfx 0.6.18
....
. Preview usage information for the other `+dfx+` command-line sub-commands by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx --help
----
+
The command displays usage information for the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.

[[net-new-project]]
== Create a new project

Applications for the {IC} start as **projects**.
You create projects using the `+dfx+` parent command and its subcommands.
Creating a new project with `+dfx+` adds a default project directory structure to your development workspace with template files to get you started.

To create a new project for your first application:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already have one open.
. Create a new project named `+hello+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new hello
----
+
The `+dfx new hello+` command creates a new `+hello+` project directory, template files, and a new `+hello+` Git repository for your project.
+
If you use a different project name instead of `+hello+`, make note of the name you used. You'll need to use that project name in place of the `+hello+` project name throughout these instructions.
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd hello
----

[[ping-the-network]]
== Check the connection to the network

Before you can deploy your first project on the {IC} network, you need to connect to the network gateway running remotely on a sub-network that you can access.
A network alias for the {IC} network gateway is configured in your project `+dfx.json+` file by default.

To check your connection to the {IC} network:

[arabic]
. Check that you are in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Check the current status of the {IC} network and your ability to connect to it by running the following command for the network alias `+ic+`:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx ping ic
----
+
If you modify the network alias for the {IC} network in your `+dfx.json+` file, replace the `+ic+` network alias with the alias you are using in this and subsequent commands.
. Verify the command returns information about the {IC} network to which you are connecting.
+
For example, you should see output similar to the following:
+
....
{
  "ic_api_version": "0.11.1"  "impl_version": "2020-10-14"
}
....

[[net-deploy]]
== Register, build, and deploy the application

After you connect to the {IC} network, you can register, build, and deploy your application.

To deploy your first application on the {IC}:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Ensure that `+node+` modules are available in your project directory, if needed, by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install
----
+
For more information about this step, see link:../developers-guide/webpack-config{outfilesuffix}#troubleshoot-node[Ensuring node is available in a project].
. Register, build, and deploy your first application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network=ic
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
For example, this step registers two network-specific identifiers—one for the `+hello+` main program and one for the `+hello_assets+` front-end user interface—and installation information similar to the following:
+
....
Deploying all canisters.
Creating canisters...
Creating canister "hello"...
"hello" canister created on network "ic" with canister id: "2lolz-fluaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q"
Creating canister "hello_assets"...
"hello_assets" canister created on network "ic" with canister id: "hupnp-k3uaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-caaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q"
Building canisters...
Building frontend...
Installing canisters...
Installing code for canister hello, with canister_id 2lolz-fluaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
Installing code for canister hello_assets, with canister_id hupnp-k3uaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-caaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
Deployed canisters.
....
+

NOTE: If you created a project with a different name, keep in mind that your canister names will match your project name instead of `+hello+` and `+hello_assets+`.

. Check that your wallet canister is properly configured and holds a balance of cycles by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=ic call <WALLET-CANISTER-ID> cycle_balance
----
+
The command returns the cycle balance for the wallet canister identifier you specified.
For example:
+
....
(99999994564407680)
....
. Call the `+hello+` canister and the predefined `+greet+` function by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call hello greet everyone
----
+
This example uses the `+dfx canister call+` command to pass "everyone" as an argument to the `+greet+` function.
+
Remember, however, that if you created a project with a different name, the canister name will match your project name and you'll need to modify the command line to match the name you used instead of `+hello+`.
. Verify the command displays the return value of the `+greet+` function.
+
For example:
+
....
("Hello, everyone!")
....
. Rerun the command to check the cycle balance for your wallet canister by running a command similar to the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister --network=ic call <WALLET-CANISTER-ID> cycle_balance
----
+
Note that a small number of cycles have been deducted from the cycle balance.
For example:
+
....
(99999994564312294)
....

[[quickstart-frontend]]
== Test the application front-end

Now that you have verified that your application has been deployed and tested its operation using the command line, let's verify that you can access the front-end pop-up window using your web browser.

. Open a browser.
. Navigate to the front-end for the application using a URL that consists of the `+hello_assets+` identifier and the `.+ic0.app+` suffix.
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following:
+
....
https://hupnp-k3uaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-caaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q.ic0.app/
....
+
Navigating to this URL displays the prompt pop-up window.
For example:
+
image:net-alert-prompt.png[Prompt pop-up window]

. Type a greeting, then click *OK* to return the greeting.
+
For example:
+
image:net-alert-window.png[Hello, everyone! greeting]
. Click *OK* to close the alert pop-up window.
