In this tutorial, you are going to write a simple calculator program that creates a single actor with several public entry-point functions to perform basic arithmetic operations.

For this tutorial, the actor is named `+Calc+`. 
The program uses the `+cell+` variable to contain an integer number that represents the current result of a calculator operation. 

This program supports the following types of function calls:

* The `+add+` function call accepts input and performs addition.
* The `+sub+` function call accepts input and performs subtraction.
* The `+mul+` function call accepts input and performs multiplication.
* The `+div+` function call accepts input and performs division.
* The `+clearall+` function clears the `+cell+` value stored as the result of previous operations, resetting the `+cell+` value to zero.

The `+div+` function also includes code to prevent the program from attempting to divide by zero.

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have downloaded and installed the SDK as described in
link:../getting-started{outfilesuffix}[Getting started].
* You have stopped any network client processes running on the local
computer.

This tutorial takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

== Create a new project

To create a new project for this tutorial:

[arabic]
. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you don’t already
have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} sample projects.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new calc
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd calc
----

== Modify the default configuration

You have already seen that creating a new project adds a default `dfx.json` configuration file to your project directory.
In this tutorial, you will modify several of the default settings to illustrate ways you can customize your project environment.

To modify the default `+dfx.json+` configuration file:

. Open the `+dfx.json+` configuration file in a text editor, then change the  default `+main.mo+` program name to `+calc_main.mo+`.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
{
  "canisters": {
    "calc": {
      "frontend": {
        "entrypoint": "src/calc/public/index.js"
      },
      "main": "src/calc/*calc_main.mo*"
    }
----
+
For this tutorial, you are changing the name of the source file from `+main.mo+` to `+calc_main.mo+` to illustrate how the setting in the `+dfx.json+` file determines the source file to be compiled. 

== Modify the default template program

You have already seen that creating a new project creates a default `+src+` directory with a template `+main.mo+` file.
In this tutorial, you will create a new `+calc_main.mo+` file for the simple calculator program.

To modify the default template source code:

. Change to the source code directory for your project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/calc
----
. Rename the template `+main.mo+` file to `+calc_main.mo+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv main.mo calc_main.mo
----
. Open the `+calc_main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+calc_main.mo+` file:
+
[source,motoko]
----
include::example$calc_main.mo[]
----
+
You might notice that this sample code uses integer (`+Int+`) data types, enabling you to use positive or negative numbers.
If you wanted to restrict the functions in this calculator code to only use positive numbers, you could change the data type to only allow natural (`+Nat+`) data.

== Build and deploy the program

You now have a program that you can compile into an executable WebAssembly module that you can deploy—using the canister model—on your local client network.

To build the program executable:

. Change to the root directory for your project,
+ 
For example, if your project directory is `+~/ic-projects+`, run the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/ic-projects/calc
----
. Build the WebAssembly executable by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build --skip-frontend
----
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
. Deploy your `+calc+` project on the local network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install calc 
----

== Verify calculator functions on the canister

You now have a program deployed as a *canister* on your local client network and can test your program by using `+dfx canister call+` commands.

To test the program you have deployed on the local client network:

. Use the `+dfx canister call+` command to call the `+calc+` canister `+add+` function and pass it the input argument `+10+` of type `+number+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call calc add 10 --type number
----
+
Verify that the command returns the value expected for the `+add+` function.
For example, the program displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*10*)
----
. Call the `+mul+` function and pass it the input argument `+3+` but let the interface description language (IDL) parse the argument type by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call calc mul '(3)'
----
+
Verify that the command returns the value expected for the `+mul+` function.
For example, the program displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*30*)
----
. Call the `+sub+` function and pass it the input argument `+5+` of type `+number+` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call calc sub 5 --type number
----
+
Verify that the command returns the value expected for the `+sub+` function.
For example, the program displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*25*)
----
. Call the `+div+` function and pass it the input argument `+5+` but let the interface description language (IDL) parse the argument type by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call calc div '(5)'
----
+
Verify that the command returns the value expected for the `+div+` function.
For example, the program displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*opt 5*)
----
. Call the `+clearall+` function and verify it resets the `+cell+` value to zero:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister call calc clearall
----
+
For example, the program displays output similar to the following:
+
[source,bash,subs="quotes"]
----
(*0*)
----
. Stop the {IC} processes running on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
