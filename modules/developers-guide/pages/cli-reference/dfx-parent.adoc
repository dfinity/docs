The DFINITY command-line execution environment (`+dfx+`) is the primary tool for creating, deploying, and managing the applications you develop for the {platform}.

Use the `+dfx+` parent command with flags and subcommands to specify the operations you want to perform with or without optional arguments.

== Basic usage

[source,bash]
----
dfx [option] [subcommand] [flag]
----

== Flags

You can use the following optional flags with the `+dfx+` parent command or with any of the `+dfx+` subcommands.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header"]
|===
|Flag |Description
|`+-h+`, `+--help+` |Displays usage information.
|`+-q+``, `+--quiet+` |Suppresses informational messages.
|`+-v+`, `+--verbose+` |Displays detailed information about operations.
|`+-V+`, `+--version+` |Displays version information.
|===

== Options

You can use the following options with the `+dfx+` command.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Description

|`+--identity <identity>+` |Specifies the user identity to use when running a command.

|`+--logfile <logfile>+` |Writes log file messages to the specified log file name if you use the `+--log file+` logging option.

|`+--log <logmode>+` |Specifies the logging mode to use.
+
You can set the log mode to one of the following:

- `+stderr+` to log messages to the standard error facility.

- `+tee+` to write messages to both standard output and to a specified file name.

- `+file+` to write messages to a specified file name.

The default logging mode is `+stderr+`.
|===

== Subcommands

Use the following subcommands to specify the operation you want to perform or to view usage information for a specific command.

For reference information and examples, select an appropriate subcommand.

[width="100%",cols="<32%,<68%",options="header",]
|===
|Command |Description
|link:dfx-bootstrap{outfilesuffix}[`+bootstrap+`] |Starts the bootstrap server you want to use to serve front-end assets for your project.

|link:dfx-build{outfilesuffix}[`+build+`] |Builds canister output from the source code in your project.

|link:dfx-cache{outfilesuffix}[`+cache+`] |Manages the `+dfx+` cache on the local computer.

|link:dfx-canister{outfilesuffix}[`+canister+`] |Manages canisters deployed on a network replica.

|link:dfx-config{outfilesuffix}[`+config+`] |Sets or changes configuration options for your current project.

|link:dfx-help{outfilesuffix}[`+help+`] |Displays usage information for a specified subcommand.

|link:dfx-identity{outfilesuffix}[`+identity+`] |Enables you to create and manage the identities used to communicate with the Internet Computer network.

|link:dfx-new{outfilesuffix}[`+new+`] |Creates a new project.

|link:dfx-ping{outfilesuffix}[`+ping+`] |Sends a response request to a specified {IC} network to determine network connectivity.
If the connection is successful, the {IC} replies with its status.

|link:dfx-replica{outfilesuffix}[`+replica+`] |Starts a local network replica process.

|link:dfx-start{outfilesuffix}[`+start+`] |Starts the local network replica and a web server for the current project.

|link:dfx-stop{outfilesuffix}[`+stop+`] |Stops the local network replica.

|link:dfx-upgrade{outfilesuffix}[`+upgrade+`] |Upgrades the version of `+dfx+` installed on the local computer to the latest version available.
|===

== Examples

You can use the `+dfx+` parent command to display usage information or version information.
For example, to display information about the version of `+dfx+` you currently have installed, you can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx --version
----

To view usage information for a specific subcommand, specify the subcommand and the `+--help+` flag.
For example, to see usage information for `+dfx build+`, you can run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
dfx build --help
----

=== Using logging options

You can use the `+--verbose+` and `+--quiet+` flags to increment or decrement the logging level.
If you don't specify any logging level, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, and INFO messages are logged by default.
Specifying one verbose flag (`+-v+`) increases the log level to include DEBUG messages.
Specifying two verbose flags (`+-vv+`)increases the logging level to include both DEBUG and TRACE messages.

Adding a `+--quiet+` flag decreases the logging level.
For example, to remove all messages, you can run a command similar the following:

[source,bash]
----
dfx -qqqq build
----

Keep in mind that using TRACE level logging (`+--vv+`) generates a lot of log messages that can affect performance and should only be used when required for troubleshooting or analysis.

To output log messages to a file named `newlog.txt` and display the messages on your terminal when creating a new project, you can run a command similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
dfx --log tee --logfile newlog.txt new hello_world
----

=== Specifying a user identity

If you create user identities with the `+dfx identity new+` command, you can then use the `+--identity+` comment-line option to change the user context when running other `+dfx+` commands.

In the most common use case, you use the `+--identity+` option to call specific canister functions to test access controls for specific operations.

For example, you might want to test whether the `+devops+` user identity can call the `+modify_profile+` function for the `+accounts+` canister by running the following command:

....
dfx --identity devops canister call accounts modify_profile '("Kris Smith")'
....
