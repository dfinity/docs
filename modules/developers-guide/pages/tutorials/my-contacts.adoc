Cascading stylesheets represent one of the most common ways to customize the user experience for an application.
This tutorial illustrates how to add a stylesheet when you use React to create a new front-end for your project.
If you already know how to add cascading stylesheets (CSS) to a React-based project, you can skip this tutorial.

NOTE: This tutorial illustrates using the React framework to manage the Document Object Model (DOM) for your canister.
Because React has its own custom DOM syntax, you need to modify the webpack configuration to compile the front-end code, which is written in JSX. For more information about learning to use React and JSX, see link:https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html[Getting started] on the https://reactjs.org/[React website].

== Before you begin

Before starting the tutorial, verify the following:

* You have `+node.js+` installed for front-end development and can install packages using `+npm install+` in your project.
For information about installing node for your local operating system and package manager, see the link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node] website.

* You have downloaded and installed the {sdk-short-name} package as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#download-and-install[Download and install].

* You have installed the Visual Studio Code plugin for {proglang} as described in link:../../quickstart/local-quickstart{outfilesuffix}#install-vscode[Install the language editor plug-in] if you are using Visual Studio Code as your IDE.

* You have stopped any {IC} network processes running on the local
computer.

NOTE: Because of significant changes to the handling of HTTP requests and front-end assets, this tutorial requires you to use the {sdk-short-name} version `+0.7.0+` or later. For an overview of what's changed, see this link:../../http-middleware{outfilesuffix}[article].

== Create a new project

To create a new project directory for your custom front-end application:

. Open a terminal shell on your local computer, if you donâ€™t already have one open.
. Change to the folder you are using for your {IC} projects, if you are using one.
. Verify that you have `+node.js+` installed locally, if necessary.
. Create a new project by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx new contacts
----
. Change to your project directory by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd contacts
----

== Install the React framework

if you've never used React before, you might want to explore the link:https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html[Intro to React] tutorial or the link:https://reactjs.org/[React website] before editing the front-end code.

To install required framework modules:

. Install the React module by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save react react-dom
----
. Install the required TypeScript language compiler loader by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save typescript ts-loader
----
. Install the required style loaders by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install --save style-loader css-loader
----
+
If the `+npm install+` command reports a vulnerability, you might also want to run the `+npm audit fix+` command to attempt to fix the vulnerability reported before continuing.
+
NOTE: As an alternative to installing these modules, you can edit the default `+package.json+` file to add dependencies for your project.
+
....
include::example$add-stylesheet-package.json[]
....
+
The version of the JavaScript agent in this example `+package.json+` file is `+0.7.2+`. In most cases, however, you would want to use the latest version of the agent available. When you create a new project, the `+dfx new+` command automatically retrieves the latest version of the JavaScript agent for you. You can also manually retrieve the latest version after creating a project by running the `+npm install --save @dfinity/agent+` command.

== Modify the default program

For this tutorial, you are going to modify the main program to with code that allows you to store and look up contact information.

To modify the default program:

. Open the `+src/contacts/main.mo+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the file:
+
[source.copy,motoko,no-repl]
----
include::example$mycontacts/contacts.mo[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+main.mo+` file to continue.

== Modify the front-end files

You are now ready to create a new front-end for your program.

. Open the webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) in a text editor.
. Modify the front-end entry to replace the default index.html with index.jsx.
+
[source,js]
----
entry: {
  // The frontend.entrypoint points to the HTML file for this build.
  // Use the next line to change the extension. For example, the
  // default configuration changes the extension to `.js`.
  index: path.join(__dirname, info.frontend.entrypoint).replace(/\.html$/, ".jsx"),
},
----
. Locate the commented example for the `+module+` key above the `+plugins+` section, then uncomment the following lines:
+
[source,js]
----
module: {
  rules: [
    { test: /\.(js|ts)x?$/, loader: "ts-loader" },
    { test: /\.css$/, use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] }
  ]
},
----
+
These settings enable your program to use the `+ts-loader+` compiler and to import CSS files.
. Save your changes and close the `+webpack.config.js+` file to continue.
. Create a new file named `+tsconfig.json+` in the root directory for your project.
. Open the `+tsconfig.json+` file in a text editor, then copy and paste the following into the file:
+
[source,json]
----
include::example$sample-tsconfig.json[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+tsconfig.json+` file to continue.

== Add a stylesheet to your project

You are now ready to create a new cascading stylesheet and add it to your project.

To add a stylesheet:

. Change to the `+src/contacts_assets/assets+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd src/contacts_assets/assets/
----
. Rename the `+main.css+` file to create a new file named `+mycontacts.css+`.
+
[source.bash]
----
mv main.css mycontacts.css
----
. Open the `+mycontacts.css+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Define some style properties for the front-end.
+
For example, copy and paste the following sample styles into the file:
+
[source,bash]
----
include::example$mycontacts/mycontacts.css[]
----
. Save your changes and close the `+mycontacts.css+` file to continue.
. Change to the `+src/contacts_assets/src+` directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../src
----
. Open the default `+index.js+` file in a text editor and delete the existing content.
. Copy and paste the following sample code into the `+index.js+` file:
+
[source,react]
----
include::example$mycontacts/mod-index.jsx[]
----
. Rename the modified `index.js` file as `index.jsx` by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mv index.js index.jsx
----
. Open the default `src/contacts_assets/src/index.html` file in a text editor, then replace `main.css` as the stylesheet file name with `mycontacts.css` and update the `body` contents with `<div id="contacts"></div>`.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>contacts</title>
    <base href="/">

    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="mycontacts.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <div id="contacts"></div>
</body>
</html>
----
. Navigate back to the root of your project directory.
+
For example:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ../../..
----

== Start the local network

Before you can build the `+contacts+` project, you need to connect to the {IC} network either running locally in your development environment or running remotely on a subnet that you can access.

To start the network locally:

[arabic]
. Open a new terminal window or tab on your local computer.
. Start the {IC} network on your local computer by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx start --background
----
+
After the local {IC} network completes its startup operations, you can continue to the next step.

== Register, build, and deploy the application

After you connect to the {IC} network running locally in your development environment, you can register, build, and deploy your application locally.

To deploy the application:

. Check that you are still in the root directory for your project, if needed.
. Register, build, and deploy your application by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy
----
+
The `+dfx deploy+` command output displays information about the operations it performs.
+
Keep in mind that because you are running the {IC} locally, the identifiers displayed when you run the `+dfx deploy+` command are only valid on the local network.
+
To deploy canisters on an external {IC} network, you must connect to that network using the `+--network+` command-line option and a specific network name or address to register identifiers on that network.
For example, to deploy on the {IC} using the reserve network alias `+ic+`, you would run a command similar the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx deploy --network=ic
----
. Copy the canister identifier for the `+contacts_assets+` canister to the clipboard or a notepad application.
+
If you didn't make a note of the canister identifier, you can look it up by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister id contacts_assets
----

== View the front-end

You can now access the front-end for the `+contacts+` program by entering the canister identifier for the assets canister in a browser.

To view the front-end:

. Open a browser and navigate to the `+local+` network address and port number specified in the `+dfx.json+` configuration file.
+
For example, if you are using the default binding for the local network, navigate to `+127.0.0.1:8000/+`.
+
To specify the canister you want the web server to display, add the `+canisterId+` parameter and the  `+contacts_assets+` canister identifier to the URL using the following syntax:
+
....
?canisterId=<YOUR-CANISTER-IDENTIFIER>
....
+
For example, the full URL should look similar to the following but with the `+canister_identifier+` that was returned by the `+dfx deploy+` command for the `+contacts_assets+`:
+
....
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=cxeji-wacaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-q
....
. Verify that you are prompted with a **My Contacts** form.
+
For example:
+
image:mycontacts-form.png[Sample front-end]

. Create one or more test records by entering text in the Name, Address, and Email input fields and a number in the Phone input field, then clicking *Add Contact*.
. Clear the form fields and type a contact name in the Lookup name field, then click *Lookup* to see the stored contact information.
+
Keep in mind that the *Lookup name* you type must be an exact match for the name of a contact you added.

== Modify the stylesheet and test your changes

After viewing the Contacts application, you might want to make some changes.

To change stylesheet properties:

. Open the `+src/contacts_assets/public/mycontacts.css+` file in a text editor and modify its style settings.
+
For example, you might want to change the background color or style the input form.
. Rebuild the project with your changes by running the following command.
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx build
----
. Deploy your project changes by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx canister install --all --mode upgrade
----
. View the results in the browser by refreshing or re-entering the canister URL.

== Modify the front-end or back-end code

If you want to explore further, you might want to experiment with modifying the front-end or back-end code for this tutorial.
For example, you might want try modifying the tutorial to do the following:

- Change the front-end code to clear the input fields after adding a new contact, for example, as part of an `+onClick+` event.
- Change the {proglang} program functions to do partial instead of exact string matching on the `+Name+` field.
- Change the {proglang} program to allow lookups based on a different field.

== Stop the local network

After you finish experimenting with your program, you can stop the local Internet Computer network so that it doesnâ€™t continue running in the background.

To stop the local network:

. In the terminal that displays network operations, press Control-C to interrupt the local network process.

. Stop the {IC} network by running the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
dfx stop
----
