An overview of the {release} release:

This release removes the `--no-wallet` parameter by making use of the fact that canisters can now have multiple controllers.

Please see below for required upgrade steps.

== Changes to DFX

=== New feature (breaking change): Remove the wallet proxy and the --no-wallet flag

Breaking change: Canister commands, except for `dfx canister create`, will make the call directly, rather than via the user's wallet. The `--no-wallet` flag is thus removed from `dfx canister` as its behavior is the default.

When working with existing canisters, use the `--wallet` flag in conjunction with `dfx identity get-wallet` in order to restore the old behavior.

You will need to upgrade your wallet and each of your existing canisters to work with the new system.  To do so, execute the following in each of your dfx projects:
[source, bash]
----
dfx wallet upgrade
dfx canister --wallet "$(dfx identity get-wallet)" update-settings --all --add-controller "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
----
To upgrade projects that you have deployed to the IC mainnet, execute the following:
[source, bash]
----
dfx wallet --network ic upgrade
dfx canister --network ic --wallet "$(dfx identity --network ic get-wallet)" update-settings --all --add-controller "$(dfx identity get-principal)"
----

=== New feature: Add --add-controller and --remove-controller flags for "canister update-settings"

`dfx canister update-settings` previously only let you overwrite the entire controller list; `--add-controller` and `--remove-controller` instead add or remove from the list.

=== New feature: Add --no-withdrawal flag for "canister delete" for when the canister is out of cycles

`dfx canister delete --no-withdrawal <canister>` can be used to delete a canister without attempting to withdraw cycles.

=== Fixed: set RUST_MIN_STACK to 8MB for ic-starter (and therefore replica)

This matches the value used in production and is meant to exceed the configured 5 MB wasmtime stack.

=== Fixed: asset uploads will retry failed requests as expected

Fixed a defect in asset synchronization where no retries would be attempted after the first 30 seconds overall.

=== Repeated warning about missing max_block_payload_size registry setting

The replica logs will display a warning about a missing registry setting approximately every five minutes.
The replica will use the required minimum value.  You can ignore this warning.

The warnings look like this:
