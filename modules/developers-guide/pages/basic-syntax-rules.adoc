One key feature of the {platform} is the {proglang} programming language. 
The {proglang} programming language is a high-level, general purpose language that is similar to other modern programming languages, but specifically designed to handle asynchronous messaging efficiently.

Although {proglang} provides an interpreter that can be used interactively and a standalone compiler, you can write programs and compile your code without using either one directly. 
Instead, in most cases, you interact with the programming language indirectly through an editor of your choice and using the `+dfx+` command-line execution tool.

To help you get started using this new language, this section provides a brief overview of the language and describes a few basic conventions for writing programs using {proglang}. 
For more complete information about programming in {proglang}, including specific language features and detailed examples, see the _Language Reference Guide_.

== Actors and asynchronous messaging

As you start to explore the {proglang} programming language, you should keep in mind that each application consists of an *actor* that communicates with other actors by passing messages asynchronously.

An actor is a special kind of object that passes its messages in an isolated state. 
When you define an actor, its messages are processed in sequence but in isolation from on each other. As an example of using actors, consider the following program:

[source,bash]
----
let result1 = await service1.computeAnswer(params);
let result2 = await service2.computeAnswer(params);
finalStep(result1, result2)
----

In this example, the program makes two requests to two distinct
services. 
Each service is implemented internally as an actor (object).
The program waits using the `+await+` keyword to wait for each result value in sequence. 
The program then uses the result from each request them in the final step, calling the function `+finalStep+`.

The actor-based programming model is particularly well-suited for writing programs intended to run on the {platform}.
However, you can also write programs in {proglang} to run on other platforms and inside of other frameworks. 
If you are writing programs to run on other platforms, you might not use actor objects or asynchronous messaging at all.

== Interface descriptions and {proglang}

To support multiple languages and cross-language communication, the {proglang} compiler automates the production and consumption of interface descriptions. 
The {proglang} compiler generates the interface descriptions using the type signatures in your {proglang} programs and the structure of imported pre-defined interfaces.

== Prelude and standard library functions

Like other languages, {proglang} includes many common functions in predefined prelude and standard library files that you can import into your programs. 
By importing the prelude or standard library, you can use common functions like `println` without explicitly defining them in your programs.

For example, you might include a line similar to the following to import list functions from the standard library: 

[source,bash]
----
import List "../../motoko/base/list";
----

== Basic language features

This section describes the basic language conventions you need to know for programming in {proglang}.

=== Comments

You can use single-line, multi-line, or nested multi-line comments to include descriptive non-executable text in your code. 
For example, use comments to add context about a code block as a note to yourself or as information you want to share with anyone reviewing or maintaining your code. 
Properly-formatted comments are treated as whitespace and ignored by the compiler.

==== Single-line comments

Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes (//) and consist of the characters following `+//+` to the end of the same line. 
For example, you can have single-line comments above, below, or on the same line as the code to which the comment applies.

[source,bash]
----
// This is a single-line comment on its own line above relevant code
import List = "ListLib";
----

==== Multi-line and nested comments

You can also include single-line, multi-line, and nested multi-line comments by starting with a forward-slash followed by an asterisk (/\*) and ending with an asterisk followed by a forward-slash (*/). 
For example:

[source,bash]
----
/* 
This is a comment that is split into 
multiple lines. 
*/
----

You can also write nested multi-line comments by starting a multi-line comment block, then starting a second multi-line comment within the first block. 
For example:

[source,bash]
----
/* This is the start of the first multi-line comment block.
   /* This is the second, nested multi-line comment. */
This is the end of the first multi-line comment block. */
----

=== Programs, declarations, and expressions

Each {proglang} program consists of zero or more declarations, followed by an optional expression. 
For example, the following snippet consists of two declarations for the variables `+x+` and `+y+` followed by an expression, forming a single program:

[source,bash]
----
let x = 1;
let y = x + 1;
x * y + x;
----

As illustrated in this example, you use a semi-colon (;) to terminate declarations and expressions. For example, to evaluate a simple equation:

[source,bash]
----
1 + 3; // When executed, the result would be "4 : Nat" value and type
----

== Numbers, text and operators

{proglang} supports the following number types:

* Natural numbers (`+Nat+`) are positive whole integers.
* Integer numbers (`+Int+`) are positive, negative, or zero whole number values.
* Floating point numbers (`+Float+`) are fractional numeric 32-bit or 64-bit values.

Basic arithmetic operators work as you would expect. For example:

[source,bash]
----
1 + 1;      // = 2
0.1 + 0.2;  // = 0.3
8 - 1;      // = 7
10 * 2;     // = 20
35 / 5;     // = 7
----

You can use double (") quotes to enclose text. For example:

[source,bash]
----
let name = "Chris"; // let name : Text = "Chris"
----

=== Relational operators

You can use the following relational operators in {proglang} programs.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Use this |To define this relationship
|`+␣<␣+` |Less than. The operator must be enclosed in whitespace.
|`+␣>␣+` |Greater than. The operator must be enclosed in whitespace.
|`+==+` |Equals.
|`+!=+` |Not equals.
|`+<=+` |Less than or equal to.
|`+>=+` |Greater than or equal to.
|===

=== Numeric binary operators

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Use this |For this operation
|`+++` |Addition.
|`+-+` |Subtraction.
|`+*+` |Multiplication.
|`+/+` |Division.
|`+%+` |Modulo.
|`+**+` |Exponentiation.
|===

=== Bitwise binary operators

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Use this |For this operation
|`+&+` |Bitwise AND.
|`+\|+` |Bitwise OR.
|`+^+` |Exclusive OR.
|`+<<+` |Shift left.
|`+␣>>+` |Shift right. The operator must be preceded by whitespace.
|`+<<>+` |Rotate left.
|`+<>>+` |Rotate right.

|`+:=+` |Assignment using an in-place update.
|`++=+` |In place addition.
|`+-=+` |In place subtraction.

|`+%=+` |In place modulo.
|`+**=+` |In place exponentiation.
|`+&=+` |In place logical AND.
|`+\|=+` |In place logical OR.
|`+^=+` |In place exclusive OR.
|`+<<=+` |In place shift left.
|`+>>=+` |In place shift right.
|`+<<>=+` |In place rotate left.
|`+<>>=+` |In place rotate right.
|`+#=+` |In place concatenation.
|===

=== Variables

Variables enable you to relate static names and types with dynamic values that are present only when a program is executed.

You can declare variable names, and if necessary the data type, using the `+let+` keyword. For example, you can use the following notation to set the variable `+x+` to the natural number 1:

[source,bash]
----
let x : Nat = 1;
----

In this example, the compiler can infer that the expression 1 has type `+Nat+`, and that `+x+` has the same type. Therefore, you can use the following annotation without changing the meaning of the program:

[source,bash]
----
let x = 1
----

=== Primitive values

{proglang} supports the following primitive types:

* Booleans (true, false)
* Integers (…​,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …​)
* Natural numbers (0, 1, 2, …​)
* Words (fixed-width numbers)
* Characters (Unicode code points)
* Text values (strings of Unicode characters)

Integers and natural numbers do not silently over- or under-flow. 
Instead, they use representations that grow to accommodate any finite number. There are also fixed-width integers and natural numbers (in 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit) types that trap on arithmetic over- and under-flow. The fixed-width integers are signed. The fixed-width natural numbers are unsigned.

Word values have fixed width. Arithmetic for Word types is performed using modulo 2**N where N is the width of the word type in bits.

{proglang} does not allow unchecked, uncaught overflows.

All primitive types are shareable so that they can be sent and received across remote function calls.

=== Non-primitive values

Building on the primitive values and types above, the language permits user-defined types, and each of the following non-primitive value forms and associated types:

* Tuples, including the unit value (the "`empty tuple`").
* Arrays, in both immutable and mutable forms.
* Objects, with named, unordered fields and methods.
* Variants, with named constructors and optional payload values.
* Function values, including shareable functions that can be called remotely.
* Async values, otherwise known as *futures* or *promises*, that can be synchronized with using `+await+`.
* Optional values, that can either be `+null+` or of the form `+? v+`, for a proper value `+v+`. 


Note that if your function is returning an optional value of type `+T+`, then the function's return type should be of the form '? T':
prefixing a type with question mark (?) adds the `null` value. 
For example, you would use the following syntax to indicate that the return value of the type identified by `+?Phone+` is optional (for example, the return value can be `+null+` as well as a proper phone number):

[source,motoko,subs="quotes"]
----
public query func lookup(name: Name): async *?Phone* {
        return A.find<Name, Phone>(book, name, nameEq);
    };
----

=== Functions

First-class functions support multiple arguments and returns and can be polymorphic.

* `+T -> U+`
* `+(T, U) -> (V, W)+`
* `+(x : T, y : U) -> V+`
* `+<A, B>(x : T, y : U) -> (V, W)+`

Functions can be defined as `+public+` or `+private+`, `+shared+`, or locally-scoped.


=== Objects and actors

Objects are structural record types with fields that can be mutable or immutable. 
Objects with immutable fields are shareable.

....
{var x : Int; color : Color}
{x : Int; color: Color}
....

Actors are restricted objects with the following characteristics:

* State must be isolated.
* Public methods are implicitly `+shared+`.
* All interactions are asynchronous.

Actor objects are marked as `+actor+` with syntax similar to the
following:

....
actor {
  private var c = 0;
  public func inc() { c += 1 };
  public func get() : async Int { c }
}
....

The fields of an actor are functions that return either:

* An empty unit return type `+()+` which is similar to a `+void+` return value.
* An `+async+` return type, which is essentially a `+promise+` to return a future value.

=== Arrays

You can define immutable or mutable arrays. 
The assignment syntax you use is the same for both immutable and mutable arrays, but you cannot change immutable arrays after allocation.

The following is an example of a simple, immutable array that holds three natural numbers, and has the type `+[Nat]+`:

[source,bash]
----
let test_array : [Nat] = [1, 2, 3] ;
----

In general, an immutable array uses square brackets around the type of the array’s elements, which must share a single common type.
Because immutable arrays cannot be modified,immutable arrays are safe to send and share.

Unlike immutable arrays, each mutable array in {proglang} introduces a private actor state which can be used locally but cannot be used in cases where immutable arrays are expected. 
Mutable arrays cannot be shared or sent in messages. 
For more information about working with arrays, see the _{proglang} Language Reference_.

=== Tuples

A tuple is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements. 
The number of element in the sequence is fixed, but the elements can consist of different data types. 
Tuples are often used when you want to have a data structure for an object with specific properties, but you don't want to create a separate type for it.

The following example defines a tuple for a three-dimensional point using integers to specify locations to represent the point on the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis and a color.

[source,bash]
----
  type Point3D = (Int, Int, Int, Color);
  let origin = (0, 0, 0, Color.Red);
  let (x, y, z, _) = origin;

  func isOrigin(p : Point3D) : Bool {
    switch p {
      case (0, 0, 0, _) true; // pattern match
      case _ false;
    }
  }
----

=== Conditional and switching

{proglang} supports all the common constructs for expressing conditions and switching between cases.

For example, you can write `+if+` and `+if else+` conditions with syntax similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
if <exp>
  ...
----

[source,bash]
----
if <exp>
  ... 
else <exp>
  ...
----

You can also use `+switch+` and `+case+` syntax similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
switch <exp> { 
  case 1 
    ...;
  case 2 
    ...;
  case 3
    ...}
----

=== While, Loops, and iteration

* `+while (p()) ...+`
* `+loop ...+`
* `+loop ... while (p())+`
* `+for (x in f()) ...+`

=== Label, break, and continue

Labels help ensure control flow is structured and can be used with the `+break+` and `+continue+` keywords.

* `+label l exp+`
* `+break l+` (more generally, `+break l exp+`)
* `+continue l+`

== Identifiers

Identifiers are alphanumeric. 
They must start with an uppercase or lowercase letter and can include a combination of uppercase or lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.

== Reserved keywords

The following keywords are reserved for specific purposes and cannot be used as identifiers or for any other purpose in {proglang} code:
